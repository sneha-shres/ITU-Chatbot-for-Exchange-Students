In the 2010s, deep learning revolutionized NLP by achieving high performance with end-to-end neural models. During the 2020s, further advancements led to the development of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. In this course, we provide a comprehensive introduction to Machine Learning (ML) for NLP and explore the latest cutting-edge research on LLMs. We build on top of Introductions to Machine Learning and cover both, theoretical and computational ML concepts and key mechanisms, as well as technical details for programming ML approaches hands-on in leading ML frameworks. In particular, this course covers: A brief recap of machine learning and natural language processing, focussed recap of deep learning, including neural networks, and discriminative learning, sequence learning including recurrent neural networks, and transformers, optimization, regularization, augmentation, transfer learning, representation learning, including autoregressive models, large language models, and multimodal LLMs, geometric deep learning, including graph neural networks, mechanistic interpretability and explainability, NLP applications, including text analysis and translation, language modelling and generation, for various fields including green and health tech. [if !supportLists] In the accompanying exercises and mini-project, we will practise to: reproduce key approaches in ML frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow, monitor and analyse training and representation of ML approaches, collaboratively develop & visualise advanced ML approaches, develop a complete ML solution on a task of choice in a small group.

Students will learn how to use dependent types to describe properties of programs, and to use session types to describe communication protocols. Students will also learn how to express a type system using typing rules.","The course is split in two parts. The first part focuses on programming in the language Idris. Idris is a dependently typed functional programming language, which means that the type system can express properties of programs. We will see how to use this for type driven development, a style of programming where the compiler is used as a tool to ensure correctness of programs. We will also discuss the theoretical foundations for Idris using the lambda calculus. In the second part, we will discuss how to safely program concurrent/distributed systems. Our main focus will be on session types, a specification language for distributed protocols. We will use session types for verifying that communicating processes never reach communication errors or deadlocks. We will touch both theoretical and applied aspects: we will learn algorithms for checking code correctness and study implementations of session types for the Erlang programming language. No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances.

Topics include Descriptive statistics Estimation, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals The law of large numbers and the Central limit theorem Statistical inference in the binomial and multinomial distributions Linear regression models – theory, estimation, model selection, model diagnostics, prediction, and interpretation Monte Carlo methods (Simulation-based methods) Statistical analysis using R Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites The course is mandatory for 2nd semester BSc in Data Science and relies particularly heavily on Linear Algebra and Optimization and Foundations of Probability . Some familiarity with general programming, such as has been achieved through Introduction to Data Science and Programming , will be assumed. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Define key statistical concepts and principles (e.g. confidence interval, p-value). For simple experimental contexts: propose a statistical model, write out the likelihood function, and find the maximum likelihood estimator for the model parameter. Perform a statistical analysis using the models covered in the course. This process includes estimation, hypothesis testing, model assessment, relating the results to the scientific question of interest, and quantification of the uncertainty about the conclusions of the analysis. Use R to compute the necessary quantities for a statistical analysis and interpret standard output from linear models fitted in R. Discuss the choice of statistical methodology using appropriate statistical theory, such as the choice of an estimator based on its theoretical properties.

Courses/course_pages/Applied information Security (Autumn 2026) ｜ learnIT (14_10_2025 18：55：21).html,Applied information Security (Autumn 2026),KSAPINS1KU,"This is a hands-on course that teaches the basic principles of computer security. You will get in-depth experience with cyberattacks, and how to prevent them. The course projects enable you to personalize the course to match your unique background.","In this course, you learn how to determine security requirements, and how to identify risks to these requirements. You get hands-on experience with concrete cyberattacks that realize these risks. You learn how to audit a system to determine that an attack has taken place. Most importantly, you get experience with many methods and tools that prevent cyberattacks, including cryptography, authentication, authorization, and isolation. Finally, you learn how to design a user experience such that users can conform to security requirements. The projects in this course give you the opportunity to immerse yourself in your choice of the many disciplines that underpin computer security, including social sciences, computer systems, programming languages, and mathematics. This course provides a window into the activities of security analysts, penetration testers, forensic analysts, security architects, and security engineers. This course can thus function as a starting point for pursuing such careers. Ultimately, the goal is to enable you to make appropriate security-related decisions. The course does so by teaching you how to think clearly about security, by focusing on basic principles. Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites Before taking this course you must: Be able to design, implement, and test, medium-sized programs in Java, C#, Python or other mainstream programming language. Have implemented at least two medium-size programming projects. Know basic algorithms and data structures. Know basic discrete mathematics. Third-semester K-SD students fulfill these requirements. These requirements can be satisfied by taking a course on Introductory Programming, Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms and Data Structures, and another course that has a programming project in it. Finally, you must meet the admission requirements of ITU. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Describe, relate, and discuss basic security principles. Identify and describe access control techniques. Identify, describe, and evaluate design approaches meeting specific security requirements Illustrate, analyse, and evaluate security standards. Identify and describe the proper use of cryptography in security. Describe and compare the most common cyberattack practices.

We discuss modern approaches to organising and reasoning about large, fast growing and diverse data-sets. We cover the principles of big data analysis, and illustrate a hands-on approach to big data modelling and management.","Big data is nowadays considered an asset that is affecting every aspect of our life. Recent developments in the technologies used by sensors, and the approaches that captures online user activities have significantly increased the size of the data that enterprises can retain, manage, and analyse. By managing and analysing these collected big data, we can create valuable opportunities. However, it also introduces several new challenges mainly due to the requirement for new systems that are capable of processing these large data. Few years ago, most data could be extracted and loaded into a single server centralised database where it could be analysed offline. Today, traditional database systems would fail to manage these data. Analysing, possibly in real-time, of big data is a key challenge for many organisations, institutions, and governments so that they can understand and adapt quickly to changing conditions. For example, a hospital could incorporate GPS data about the actual location of its ambulances and helicopters with data about the mission these vehicles are involved in, as well as emergency calls and current status in various emergency rooms in order to make decisions in real-time when faced with an emergency call (also in the face of large-scale disasters). Big data management denotes the processes involved in making data from various data sources available for advanced analytics. There is no longer one approach that can fit all data management problems. For each problem, IT specialists have to decide on appropriate models and large scale data analysis systems to handle the relevant data. This course addresses the technical issues that emerge during the collection, management, processing, and analytics of large-scale data. In this course we introduce modern approaches to organising and analysing large, fast growing and diverse data-sets. We will cover the characteristics and principles of big data analysis and the platforms and tools that are capable of managing big data. Students will be introduced to the technical skills necessary for assessment of current approaches to big data management and analytics and will acquire a hands-on experience using these technologies. The main objectives of the course are to learn about the following: Parallel and distributed computing platforms. Writing analytics tasks (algorithms and queries) for these scalable platforms. Running analytics tasks on large clusters of machines. Understand how dividing a large job into parallel tasks can enhance the execution time of such job (i.e. improve its performance). Along the way, students are expected to (1) learn programming languages that enables them to write analytics applications (such as Python and Scala); (2) understand and write distributed applications for distributed computing platforms such as Spark; and (3) acquire experience running their code on public clouds such as AWS. Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites This course assumes basic computer science and programming background. It requires that the participants have taken the introductory programming courses and a data modelling course (Introduction to Database Design) for the Software Development or Software Design study programmes. Moreover the student must always meet the admission requirements of the IT University. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Identify and explain the main principles and theoretical concepts of big data management systems. Analyze and discuss the characteristics and societal issues of data exploration and analysis with large, fast-growing, and diverse datasets. Reflect upon the relative merits of distributed computing platforms in the context of big data management. Use distributed computing platforms to implement end-to-end solutions for real-world analytics problems. Design, conduct, and report results of experiments using the developed applications in a distributed setting over a cluster of machines.

The course enables students to navigate complex technical challenges and meaningfully participate in debates regarding the management of IT. Students learn to understand technical challenges in computing within in organizational, historical, and cultural context. The course is at an introductory level and is well-suited for students with limited or no technical background. Description This course equips students with computational literacies to understand organizational challenges faced in the management of large-scale IT systems and to meaningfully participate in debates regarding the political and ecological implications of IT systems. The course introduces key computational concepts used in the analysis and implementation of IT systems. Students will learn to navigate technical aspects of computational systems and IT work including the terminologies, methodologies, and artifacts used in the development of IT systems. The course will incorporate historical, cultural, and material perspectives on computing to understand how the technological stack that supports contemporary computational systems emerged and to contextualize current controversies within long-standing debates in computing as an academic discipline and labor sector. Students will learn about organizational and infrastructural challenges that emerge at different layers of the technological stack over the lifetime of computational systems from design and development to long-term maintenance and ends-of support, including challenges that arise due to processes such as continuous change, scaling systems, technical debt, obsolescence, breakdown, and failure. Through hands-on exercises students will develop skills to contextualize debates and challenges by locating and analyzing a variety of primary and secondary sources related to specific instances of IT systems implementations. Students will acquire skills in source criticism – considering genre, form, authority, and point of view. They will develop a basic understanding of how various genres of technical communication emerged historically, are crafted and used by technical actors, and mediate the management of IT work. Students will learn a variety of analytical methods that can be applied to these different genres to empirically explore how technical actors deploy them in their work. Finally, students will also playfully engage these genres to reflect upon how to intervene discursively and materially into the complex challenges and debates of today’s IT landscape.

In highlighting the various ethical dilemmas that can arise in data saturated worlds, the course encourages students to contextualize, critique, and reflect upon how data are generated, for whom, and to what effects. It guides students in this endeavor by adopting a critical data studies approach focused on analyzing the structural conditions through which data emerge and have serious effects on the world. The course supports students in conducting an ethical analysis of a contemporary data dilemma arising within the public and private sectors.","Our contemporary moment is increasingly characterized by and through data. Data have, in many ways, become central to our modes of social, political, and economic organization: from new forms of economics (crypto, platform capitalism) to sensing-based living environments (smartification), to algorithmic and AI driven education, health, justice, and welfare governance mechanisms. In this process, it is claimed that data are transforming people, organizations, governments, and societies. Such a ‘data moment’ poses important empirical, theoretical, and ethical challenges that this course investigates and reflects upon. In occupying such a central role in how we build our institutions, our politics, and our social worlds – in essence how we imagine our connections to one another –data triggers a vast range of competing claims about ‘how we can live together’ both now and in the future. As such it is an object of intense ethical concern. But given the accelerated and expansive nature of datafication, the conditions for conducting ethical analysis are both increasingly complex, yet ever so urgent.

Courses/course_pages/Data Visualisation and Data-driven Decision Making (Spring 2026) ｜ learnIT (14_10_2025 19：07：54).html,Data Visualisation and Data-driven Decision Making (Spring 2026),BSDVDDM1KU,"The course is focused on forming the basis of a data communicator. The students should recognize the various features of the human perception system, and operate around those limitations. We expect a student to be able to create effective visual encodings (charts), data-driven stories, dashboards and storyboards. The course will empower students with the underlying assumptions, guidelines and trappings of visualizing quantitative information. In doing so, the curriculum will put the field of data visualization in context; touching on its history from the first historic examples, right up until the propensity today of misleading people.","The clear communication of analytic results is the primary end goal of a scientific endeavor. The origin of a data science project is the question “What do we want to communicate and how?” The “how” heavily depends on data visualization, a core activity needed from the very early exploratory phases to the eventual explanatory phases. Moreover, creating visualizations is not simply an activity to wrap up a project at the end: it is rather an objective that informs all phases of data analysis, including the early stages of interrogating datasets to better understand them. One cannot rely on the unprincipled application of graphical capabilities (and defaults of standard software) such as bar/line/pie charts, because each visual choice has repercussions in perception, interpretation, and internalization of information. In addition, the accumulation of smaller design decisions can result in a wide range of effectiveness. In light of these challenges, this course aims to substantially equip Data Science students with methods, tools and tactics for critical reasoning along their future paths of working with quantitative data. The following subjects will be covered in the course: Introduction– Why We Visualize and a History of Information Graphics Visual Vocabulary: A Tour through the Dataviz Zoo Human Perception and the Visual System The Details of Information Design Geospatial Visualization Design Thinking, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) & Decision Support Aesthetics and Visual Appeal for Attraction, Clarity & Memorability Network Visualization Storytelling & Data-Driven Journalism Visual Literacy (Graphicacy) and Xenographics Miscommunication and How to Spot Lies | Ethical Encoding on a Truth Continuum Uncertainty: How to Visualize it Visual analytics / dashboarding Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites The course mandatory for BSc in Data Science fourth semester. The course requires basic programming skills and basic statistical knowledge. Specifically, the students should have basic skills in Python programming (loop structures, data types), and have knowledge of: probability spaces, random variables, conditional and joint probability, independence, expectation, variance, correlation and covariance, law of large numbers, confidence intervals. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Define data visualization (versus information graphics, or information visualization) and explain the differences in visualization purposes, from exhibitroy to exploratory and explanatory. Identify the most appropriate visualization strategy given the result of an data analysis process and an intended communication objective. Follow a checklist of established design guidelines when building a visualization to account for human perception, communicating uncertainty, and reducing potential miscommunication. Conversely, students should be able to readily identify instances where general guidelines should be broken, and provide practical and theoretically informed arguments supporting their design decisions. Produce alternative visualizations for the same message, compare their relative strengths and weaknesses, and make a motivated choice for the preferred one given the intended communication outcome. Identify deceptive usage of visual communication, or unintentionally misleading graphical representations of data (evidence). Explain ethical considerations, specifically the consequences of misinformation, and the motivations why data should not be visualized in specific ways. Generalize standard visualization techniques and customize them to better fit the visual literacy and/or intended communication outcome for a particular audience with domain-specific problems. Likewise, participants will explore methods for relentlessly expanding the truthfulness of their models when abstracting data from the real world.

The course introduces students to research and cases that focus on automated systems from decision-making systems based on artificial intelligence to systems facing citizens like chatbots and welfare technology such as VR or robots. Analyzing automated systems for welfare purposes is done to better understand their situation of use. Students will get a better understanding of what it means to use/collaborate/be used by automated systems. This leads to insights pertaining to data ethics and social justice as examples of how a broader context for systems development and implementation can impact citizens’ possibilities to act autonomously in a digitalized welfare state. After finishing the course students will know how to consult and (project)manage digitalization processes in private businesses and public organizations with insight into the complex relations between automation and social justice. Specifically, the course aims at bringing to the fore issues of data ownership, data experience, data work, and data governance. These four themes inform the selection of readings, the lectures, and the workshops. The course is distinct in its focus on building sociological imagination and robust analytical skills in the students as they learn about how they can impact digitalization projects. The motto of the course: Data ethics is not enough when putting in place the infrastructures of future digitalized societies. We also need an understanding of social justice in the context of digitalization. Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Explain key elements of social justice as explained in the literature. Describe differences between automated digital systems based on their effects on citizen autonomy. Generate examples of the role of data in contemporary public-private partnerships. Analyse consequences of data collection and use by these partnerships for citizens (individuals and groups). Discuss and suggest ways in which social justice can become part of technology design for future societies.

After finishing the course students will know how to consult and (project)manage digitalization processes in private businesses and public organizations with insight into the complex relations between automation and social justice. Specifically, the course aims at bringing to the fore issues of data ownership, data experience, data work, and data governance. These four themes inform the selection of readings, the lectures, and the workshops. The course is distinct in its focus on building sociological imagination and robust analytical skills in the students as they learn about how they can impact digitalization projects. The motto of the course: Data ethics is not enough when putting in place the infrastructures of future digitalized societies. We also need an understanding of social justice in the context of digitalization. Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Explain key elements of social justice as explained in the literature. Describe differences between automated digital systems based on their effects on citizen autonomy. Generate examples of the role of data in contemporary public-private partnerships. Analyse consequences of data collection and use by these partnerships for citizens (individuals and groups). Discuss and suggest ways in which social justice can become part of technology design for future societies.

All use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed during the exam, as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines on generative artificial intelligence . Description In this course, the students will discover all the software engineering activities that take place after an initial software product is delivered or after a legacy system is taken over from a theoretical and practical perspective. Students (in groups) will take over such a system that is live and serving users, refactor and migrate it to the languages and technologies of their liking. All subsequent DevOps, software evolution and software maintenance activities will be performed directly on the systems of the students. Students will learn DevOps, Software Evolution, and Software Maintenance concepts via: Using Linux/Unix based operating systems via the command line (Bash) Virtualization via containers and virtual machines Continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery, and continuous deployment Version control systems (Git), various branching strategies, and collaborative development workflows Coding standards, static analysis, linters, etc. Collaborative development process with code reviews, pair programming Time-planning and scheduling in software engineering projects Techniques for division of subsystems across multiple platforms Logging and log analysis Monitoring Scalability, load balancing Service-level agreements Security of web-facing applications Deployment strategies Technical Debt & Maintainability Refactoring and evolution of legacy systems The course consists of weekly workshop sessions (4h), which include lecture style teaching and interactive lab style exercises. Additionally, students work in project groups (favorably five persons) together during the entire course. Project milestones, such as setup and configuration of a CI tool, automatic deployment of a software system, inclusion of new features, such as, logging, monitoring, etc. will serve as assignments. Since we continuously deploy software on infrastructure as a service (IaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS) services and depending on the chosen services, each group might need some funding. Usually, each group should not use more than $10 per person over the run of the course. Students will not have to buy any books for this course on the other hand. Some of the services that we intend to use offer free credits for new users via the GitHub Student Developer Pack . Formal prerequisites Familiarity with at least one object-oriented programming language, such as Java, C#, etc. Be able to design, implement, and test medium-sized object-oriented programs. That includes the use of concepts such as classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, packages, data structures, concurrent programming , IO operations, basic GUI, and basic web programming. Be able to design, create, and use test medium-sized (relational) databases. That includes the use of concepts such as tables, primary, and foreign keys, normalization, etc. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Explain, apply and reflect on the principles of DevOps and its constituents, including application of its concepts for software maintenance and evolution. Describe and apply various methods and strategies for, amongst others, continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, logging, monitoring, scalability, version control with branching, virtualization, maintenance, and handling of technical debt and their role in the context of DevOps. Explain and be able to execute all software engineering activities necessary to operate, evolve, and maintain a minimal-viable-prototype. Document and explain all steps during software maintenance and refactoring, e.g., with developer logs and the design and architecture of web-systems through the use of common standards for documentation including UML and standard documentation tools. Design and implement distributed and/or layered software using a suitable programming language and corresponding tools and frameworks for data storage, logging, monitoring, etc. Continuously maintain and evolve (refactor) a software system through adjustments in its architecture or refinements in its configuration.

All subsequent DevOps, software evolution and software maintenance activities will be performed directly on the systems of the students. Students will learn DevOps, Software Evolution, and Software Maintenance concepts via: Using Linux/Unix based operating systems via the command line (Bash) Virtualization via containers and virtual machines Continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery, and continuous deployment Version control systems (Git), various branching strategies, and collaborative development workflows Coding standards, static analysis, linters, etc. Collaborative development process with code reviews, pair programming Time-planning and scheduling in software engineering projects Techniques for division of subsystems across multiple platforms Logging and log analysis Monitoring Scalability, load balancing Service-level agreements Security of web-facing applications Deployment strategies Technical Debt & Maintainability Refactoring and evolution of legacy systems The course consists of weekly workshop sessions (4h), which include lecture style teaching and interactive lab style exercises. Additionally, students work in project groups (favorably five persons) together during the entire course. Project milestones, such as setup and configuration of a CI tool, automatic deployment of a software system, inclusion of new features, such as, logging, monitoring, etc. will serve as assignments. Since we continuously deploy software on infrastructure as a service (IaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS) services and depending on the chosen services, each group might need some funding. Usually, each group should not use more than $10 per person over the run of the course. Students will not have to buy any books for this course on the other hand. Some of the services that we intend to use offer free credits for new users via the GitHub Student Developer Pack . All use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed during the exam, as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines on generative artificial intelligence . Formal prerequisites Familiarity with at least one object-oriented programming language, such as Java, C#, etc. Be able to design, implement, and test medium-sized object-oriented programs. That includes the use of concepts such as classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, packages, data structures, concurrent programming , IO operations, basic GUI, and basic web programming. Be able to design, create, and use test medium-sized (relational) databases. That includes the use of concepts such as tables, primary, and foreign keys, normalization, etc. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Explain, apply and reflect on the principles of DevOps and its constituents, including application of its concepts for software maintenance and evolution. Describe and apply various methods and strategies for, amongst others, continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, logging, monitoring, scalability, version control with branching, virtualization, maintenance, and handling of technical debt and their role in the context of DevOps. Explain and be able to execute all software engineering activities necessary to operate, evolve, and maintain a minimal-viable-prototype. Document and explain all steps during software maintenance and refactoring, e.g., with developer logs and the design and architecture of web-systems through the use of common standards for documentation including UML and standard documentation tools. Design and implement distributed and/or layered software using a suitable programming language and corresponding tools and frameworks for data storage, logging, monitoring, etc. Continuously maintain and evolve (refactor) a software system through adjustments in its architecture or refinements in its configuration. Analyze, discuss, choose, and relate different technologies and frameworks for their suitability in certain development and production scenarios. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different methods and practices for designing and developing software continuously. Identify and present current work practices and discuss potential modifications/improvements of these for adoption of DevOps principles.

Since we continuously deploy software on infrastructure as a service (IaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS) services and depending on the chosen services, each group might need some funding. Usually, each group should not use more than $10 per person over the run of the course. Students will not have to buy any books for this course on the other hand. Some of the services that we intend to use offer free credits for new users via the GitHub Student Developer Pack . All use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed during the exam, as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines on generative artificial intelligence . Formal prerequisites Familiarity with at least one object-oriented programming language, such as Java, C#, etc. Be able to design, implement, and test medium-sized object-oriented programs. That includes the use of concepts such as classes, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, packages, data structures, concurrent programming , IO operations, basic GUI, and basic web programming. Be able to design, create, and use test medium-sized (relational) databases. That includes the use of concepts such as tables, primary, and foreign keys, normalization, etc. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Explain, apply and reflect on the principles of DevOps and its constituents, including application of its concepts for software maintenance and evolution. Describe and apply various methods and strategies for, amongst others, continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, logging, monitoring, scalability, version control with branching, virtualization, maintenance, and handling of technical debt and their role in the context of DevOps. Explain and be able to execute all software engineering activities necessary to operate, evolve, and maintain a minimal-viable-prototype. Document and explain all steps during software maintenance and refactoring, e.g., with developer logs and the design and architecture of web-systems through the use of common standards for documentation including UML and standard documentation tools. Design and implement distributed and/or layered software using a suitable programming language and corresponding tools and frameworks for data storage, logging, monitoring, etc. Continuously maintain and evolve (refactor) a software system through adjustments in its architecture or refinements in its configuration. Analyze, discuss, choose, and relate different technologies and frameworks for their suitability in certain development and production scenarios. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different methods and practices for designing and developing software continuously. Identify and present current work practices and discuss potential modifications/improvements of these for adoption of DevOps principles.

Courses/course_pages/Digital Material Interactions (Autumn 2026) ｜ learnIT (14_10_2025 19：09：46).html,Digital Material Interactions (Autumn 2026),BADIMAI1KU,Replacement course for BDDIT 2023 or earlier (DIMIA).,"As an interaction designer in the era of connected everyday devices, the ability to express and explore design ideas for connected artifacts and IoT is a vital skill. This course empowers students with the theoretical understanding and practical skills to achieve this. This course will address the user experience of connected devices and services: Examples could be the case of renting a city bike or creating an artifact that responds to weather forecasts. Through hands-on work, exercises and a collaborative group project, the course uses hardware and software as design materials for creating intended user experiences with IoT and connected devices. Students will learn how prototyping with these materials can support the exploratory phases of designing interactions for connected systems. The course emphasizes practical investigations and micro-experiments in constructing IoT prototypes. This includes programming various standard devices and small network-connected microcontrollers. Students will explore interaction modalities between humans and digital technology using analog and digital sensors and actuators, all within the context of connectedness. Conceptually, students will gain an understanding of how to design for connected environments, where everyday devices communicate and interact. The course builds upon students' programming skills from the “Creative Programming” and 'Physical Computing' courses. The course is based on relatively simple programming, but students may use generative AI for assistance and troubleshooting. Replacement course for BDDIT 2023 or earlier (DIMIA). Use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed with restrictions during the exam (see LearnIT), as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines ongenerative artificial intelligence . Formal prerequisites This course builds upon the knowledge and programming skills acquired during the “Physical Computing” course and the “Creative Programming” course (mandatory courses on BDDIT). Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Construct interactive network-connected prototypes using microprocessors, analog and digital sensors/actuators, and standard devices (e.g., smartphones). Explain the fundamental principles behind connected artifacts and the Internet of Things (IoT). Discuss the challenges for interaction design when the user experience is distributed among different devices with very different capabilities Ordinary exam Exam type: D: Submission of written work with following oral, External (Pass / Fail) Exam variation: D2G: Submission for groups with following oral exam supplemented by the submission.

Abstractions from mathematics pervade computer science, and to truly excel at both programming computers and model aspects of the real world in computers, one must understand the core vocabulary of mathematics provided in this course. The course aims at providing the basics of the mathematical foundations of computer science. The course develops the necessary terminology and conceptual tools needed for later courses. This includes: formal reasoning, induction, set theory, relations and functions models of computation, such as finite state machines and grammars basic graph theory, language theory combinatorics, probability and number theory Central terms and concepts: Logic, specifications, sets and sequences, functions, sums, induction and recursion, number theory, permutations and combinations, discrete probability, relations, graphs, trees, finite state machines, grammars and theory of computation. Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites There are no formal prerequisites. However, we expect that you remember how to do basic high school algebra (solving linear and quadratic equations; simplifying arithmetic expressions; working with fractions, exponentiations, and logarithms; inequalities). The course starts with a very quick refresher on these topics in the first week. But we recommend the Algebra 1 course on khanacademy.org if you need a more thorough refresher. Please note that this course is not open to bachelor-students. Instead bachelor students can take the SWU Bachelor course: Foundations of Computing - Discrete Mathematics BSc. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Describe and apply formal definitions Conduct and explain basic formal proofs Work with regular languages and finite state machines Use models of computation and specification Use combinatorial reasoning Assess probabilities of events Use basic modular arithmetic Ordinary exam Exam type: A: Written exam on premises, External (7-point scale) Exam variation: A33: Written exam on premises on paper with restrictions The course aims at providing the basics of the mathematical foundations of computer science.

There will be an introduction to the recognised frameworks and models in Enterprise Architecture.","In digital organisations, the business rely on IT to deliver value. As business changes, the IT that delivers strategy must change. Enterprise Architecture (EA) supports the intent of determining how an organization can execute their strategies by applying architecture principles and practices in order to guide them through business, information, process and technology changes. Aligning architecture with business strategy accelerates business goal achievement. Enterprise Architects coordinate architectural work across the organisation to ensure alignment across solutions and value streams. To support business achievement and remain competitive, enterprises will need to digitally transform their operations and business solutions. The course will give an understanding of how EA can be used to analyse the current IT landscape of complex organisations. The complexity of both the public and private sector will be presented in accordance with the theories.

Ordinary exam Exam type: C: Submission of written work, Internal (7-point scale) Exam variation: C1G: Submission of written work for groups In digital organisations, the business rely on IT to deliver value. As business changes, the IT that delivers strategy must change. Enterprise Architecture (EA) supports the intent of determining how an organization can execute their strategies by applying architecture principles and practices in order to guide them through business, information, process and technology changes. Aligning architecture with business strategy accelerates business goal achievement. Enterprise Architects coordinate architectural work across the organisation to ensure alignment across solutions and value streams. To support business achievement and remain competitive, enterprises will need to digitally transform their operations and business solutions. The course will give an understanding of how EA can be used to analyse the current IT landscape of complex organisations.

In this course, students learn to analyze work systems within organizations and to identify ways for improving them. Students acquire these skills by analyzing a real-world work system and by gaining hands-on experience suggesting requirements for a sociotechnical system that supports the work system.","The objective of this course is to enable students to analyze enterprise-level work systems (including activities & processes, the information involved in them, and the supporting technologies), to help organizations design & implement functionality associated with enterprise systems and platform-based solutions to improve information management at an enterprise level. While enterprise systems such as ERP, CRM, and SCM remain central to business operations, the rise of platform ecosystems adds new opportunities and challenges for managing information across internal and external boundaries. These platforms support modularity, extensibility, and collaboration across organizational ecosystems, changing the way digital services and applications are developed and integrated. Key topics include: Enterprise systems and their role in managing processes and information The evolution and architecture of platform ecosystems Work system analysis and design Sociotechnical requirements engineering Through lectures, hands-on labs, and a group project, students explore how integrated processes and platform-based ecosystems can create business value. Students work with enterprise and platform software to prototype or configure solutions tailored to real-world business needs. NB: Use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed with restrictions (see LearnIT), as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines on generative artificial intelligence. Formal prerequisites There are no formal prerequisites for this course. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Describe different types of enterprise systems, collaboration systems and platform ecosystems and their role in supporting information management and business process innovation.

It engages with games and play from a historical perspective, establishing a common ground for communication about games and player cultures among students from different backgrounds.","Games and Play are fundamental phenomena found in every society throughout history. They are forms of entertainment, and also part of many cultural discourses, as well as modes of behaviour and communication. Lately they have evolved, through computer technology, into the most prominent form of digital culture and expression. Students will learn how to analyse games and their relation to culture at large in order to discuss games from various theoretical, cultural and critical perspectives, classify them according to taxonomies and assess their use in various contexts. This course offers a broad overview of the fundamental concepts, theories and approaches to games and play. We will discuss a selection of the main critical and research approaches. The main topics of the course are as follows: Defining and analysing games and play Games as sign-systems and rule-systems Quest games, narrative, and fiction Space and time in games Avatars, Characters, and Agency Representation in and of games and their players Games as transmedia and cross media artefacts Players and fans Materialities of games Doing games research and applying it to practices The politics and ideologies of games, player cultures, edutainment and gamification Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites There are no formal prerequisites. Making games involves analyzing games, which inevitably raises philosophical, sociological, and aesthetic questions. Games & Culture provides the necessary theories and concepts from the humanities and social sciences. Because of the importance of theory and research, you will have to engage with the course readings and be open to theoretical and analytical issues. You are expected to prepare for and actively participate in the course. Through the lectures, discussions, and exercises, the course builds your ability to analyze games and player cultures thoroughly and in writing, thus providing important competencies for any game developer, game designer, and game scholar. You will also need to study a broad range of games in a systematic manner. We don't believe in prescribing a canon of digital games. All of us have, however, only first-hand experience with a limited number of examples, which are not necessarily the games/game series/genres that we encounter frequently in research and in your studies. Additionally, it is impossible to discuss the history and significance of digital games without touching on specific examples. To save you from unpleasant surprises and the frustration of feeling like there is a 'secret list of games one should know', we have prepared below an itemized overview of types of games (with some examples each) that will come up in the lectures. It will help you engage with lectures and readings better (and, needless to say, expand your vocabulary of digital games) if you look up (i.e. get some casual play experience with or watch videos of) the following: Early games: Spacewar, Pong, Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong Text Adventures (e.g. Colossal Cave Adventure, Zork, Hunt the Wumpus) Genre definers: Super Mario Bros. Tetris SimCity Myst Diablo Tomb Raider Grand Theft Auto III Graphic Adventures (e.g. Day of the Tentacle or Monkey Island) Early First-Person Shooters (e.g. Doom, Half-Life 1+2) CRPGs (e.g. Final Fantasy-, Fallout-, Elder Scrolls-series) 'Immersive Simulation' games (e.g. System Shock, Deus Ex, Bioshock) Survival Horror (e.g. Resident Evil, Silent Hill) RTS (e.g. Warcraft, Starcraft) MMO (e.g. World of Warcraft, EVE online) 'Walking Simulators' (e.g. Gone Home, What Remains of Edith Finch) Open World Games (e.g. Assassin's Creed, Horizon: Zero Dawn) Roguelikes & Rogue-lites (Spelunky, Binding of Isaac, FTL) Metroidvanias (Metroid, Castlevania, Dead Cells, Hollow Knight) Casual Games (e.g. Flappy Bird, Candy Crush Saga) Autobiographical Games (e.g. Depression Quest, Dys4ia) Care Games (e.g. The Sims, Animal Crossing) Needless to say, this list is constantly evolving and incomplete. We will e.g. also touch on non-digital forms, from board games to Pen-and-Paper RPGs and LARPs. The important thing is that you remain curious about all kinds of games and expand your horizon, so you can put games and their players into perspective even better. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Discuss games, play and player cultures from a variety of theoretical, cultural and critical perspectives (e.g. semiotics, procedurality, representation). Systematically classify games and playful activities. Contextualize games in a historical and generic perspective. Analyse and interpret games using established or adapted analysis methods. Develop coherent arguments that engage critically with theories, definitions, and categorizations. Independently examine the state of the art in specific game studies topics by doing a bibliography and presenting the results in a standardized format. Reflect on cultural biases, stereotypes, and discrimination within the domain of play and games. Examine game culture as a part of a larger media ecology of fandom, transmedia franchises, social media etc. Ordinary exam Exam type: C: Submission of written work, External (7-point scale) Exam variation: C11: Submission of written work Students will learn how to analyse games and their relation to culture at large in order to discuss games from various theoretical, cultural and critical perspectives, classify them according to taxonomies and assess their use in various contexts.

Systematically classify games and playful activities. Contextualize games in a historical and generic perspective. Analyse and interpret games using established or adapted analysis methods. Develop coherent arguments that engage critically with theories, definitions, and categorizations. Independently examine the state of the art in specific game studies topics by doing a bibliography and presenting the results in a standardized format. Reflect on cultural biases, stereotypes, and discrimination within the domain of play and games. Examine game culture as a part of a larger media ecology of fandom, transmedia franchises, social media etc. Ordinary exam Exam type: C: Submission of written work, External (7-point scale) Exam variation: C11: Submission of written work This course offers a broad overview of the fundamental concepts, theories and approaches to games and play. We will discuss a selection of the main critical and research approaches. The main topics of the course are as follows: Defining and analysing games and play Games as sign-systems and rule-systems Quest games, narrative, and fiction Space and time in games Avatars, Characters, and Agency Representation in and of games and their players Games as transmedia and cross media artefacts Players and fans Materialities of games Doing games research and applying it to practices The politics and ideologies of games, player cultures, edutainment and gamification Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites There are no formal prerequisites. Making games involves analyzing games, which inevitably raises philosophical, sociological, and aesthetic questions. Games & Culture provides the necessary theories and concepts from the humanities and social sciences. Because of the importance of theory and research, you will have to engage with the course readings and be open to theoretical and analytical issues. You are expected to prepare for and actively participate in the course. Through the lectures, discussions, and exercises, the course builds your ability to analyze games and player cultures thoroughly and in writing, thus providing important competencies for any game developer, game designer, and game scholar. You will also need to study a broad range of games in a systematic manner. We don't believe in prescribing a canon of digital games. All of us have, however, only first-hand experience with a limited number of examples, which are not necessarily the games/game series/genres that we encounter frequently in research and in your studies. Additionally, it is impossible to discuss the history and significance of digital games without touching on specific examples. To save you from unpleasant surprises and the frustration of feeling like there is a 'secret list of games one should know', we have prepared below an itemized overview of types of games (with some examples each) that will come up in the lectures. It will help you engage with lectures and readings better (and, needless to say, expand your vocabulary of digital games) if you look up (i.e. get some casual play experience with or watch videos of) the following: Early games: Spacewar, Pong, Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Donkey Kong Text Adventures (e.g. Colossal Cave Adventure, Zork, Hunt the Wumpus) Genre definers: Super Mario Bros.

Massive geospatial data are generated every second from our smartphones, through our social media posts, or through many kinds of other means like tracked whale trajectories in the ocean, allowing us to trace the movements of entire societies. As these data keep growing, it becomes more important to extract meaningful insights from location, relation, and position, for applications as diverse as business analytics, epidemiology, or species protection. This course provides students core competences in Geospatial Data Science (GDS). This includes the following: Data structures and principles of GIS; map projections and measurement Gathering and preprocessing large-scale geospatial data State-of-the-art computational tools for GDS Spatial network analysis Main methodologies available to the Geospatial Data Scientist, as well as their intuition as to how and when they can be applied Real world applications of these techniques in an applied context Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites A prerequisite for taking this course is solid know-how in Python programming and data analysis. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Demonstrate GIS/GDS concepts and be able to use relevant Python libraries programmatically to import, manipulate and analyze spatial data in different formats. Apply a number of spatial analysis techniques and explain how to interpret the results, in a process of turning data into insights. Reflect on the motivation and inner workings of the main methodological approaches of GDS, both analytical and visual. Critically evaluate the suitability of a specific GDS technique, what it can offer and how it can help answer questions of interest. Apply a number of spatial analysis techniques and explain how to interpret the results, in a process of turning data into insights. When faced with a new data-set, work independently using GIS/GDS tools programmatically to extract valuable insight.

Description Over the last decades, the global distribution of cooperative work tasks has become commonplace in a globalized world. Consequently, cooperative actors are increasingly engaged with the coordination of globally distributed work task. At one level, the global distribution of cooperative work tasks creates a number of specific challenges. That is, spatial, temporal and cultural distance has to be negotiated and bridged. This course considers the nature as well as the challenges associated with global project management, cases include e.g. global software development and ICT interventions for development in the Global South. During the course the students will relate to: • The processes of globalization that makes global projects common • Introduction to (global) project management • Cases of global project management from organisational practice (e.g. industry, public sector, NGOs). • Challenges that are particular to global interaction and coordination (e.g. culture, distance, time difference) • Various practices of coordination that may be used in global projects • Information technology for development in a global perspective NB: All use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed during the exam, as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines on generative artificial intelligence. Formal prerequisites - Students should be able to formulate a research question - Students should be able to search for and cite literature Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Formulate a research question within the area of global project management related to e.g. globalisation, co-operation, organisation, information technology, collaboration, culture, documents and coordinative artefacts Identify, select, and analyse relevant material e.g. theoretical concepts, methods, and empirical material for the research question Identify and critically discuss challenges and theoretical concepts relevant to global project management according to academic standards Ordinary exam Exam type: C: Submission of written work, Internal (7-point scale) Exam variation: C11: Submission of written work This course considers the nature as well as the challenges associated with ‘global project management and IT’.

"Courses/course_pages/IT and Green Transitions, BSc (Autumn 2026) ｜ learnIT (27_10_2025 18：15：27).html","IT and Green Transitions, BSc (Autumn 2026)",BBITGRT1KU,The course aims at giving the students an introduction to the complexities of determining how processes of digitalisation and green transitions are entangled.,"The world is facing severe social, economic and ecological challenges in relation to climate change. This situation has called for mitigation activities to be rolled out across numerous spheres of society. At the same time, digitalization appears to be rapidly increasing in many parts of the world, which means that the mitigation of climate change is difficult to imagine without digital technologies. The big question, then, is how digitalization can play an important and constructive role in creating the desired and necessary green transitions. In this course, students will be introduced to the work of a number of researchers affiliated with the ITU’s Center for Climate IT. The different researchers will present various perspectives on the grand challenges of connecting IT to green transitions. For example, computer scientists may address initiatives within machine learning and energy efficiency of algorithms and/or hardware interfaces, data scientists look at urban planning and mobility challenges, researchers within digital design may focus on designing ’green IT’ and influencing consumer behaviour and choices toward more climate-conscious ways of living (artefacts with climate biographies, responsible infrastructures, play, and AI), while social scientists may focus on the conceptual, organizational, infrastructural and managerial opportunities and challenges of digital technologies in relation to climate change mitigation as both a ’business problem’ and a societal problem. Bringing these different approaches and perspectives to bear in an inter- and cross-disciplinary setting affords the possibility of enriching our understanding of climate related problems and potential ways of addressing them. The course urges students to engage in-depth with the different approaches to the relations between digitalisation and green transitions, and to think of their entanglement as a mix of mono- and interdisciplinary challenges that require new and inventive methods, tools and theories. NB: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites Students are expected to have completed as a minimum 2 years of BSc studies. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Describe and discuss some of the challenges that are located at the intersection of digitalization and green transitions. Describe and reflect upon the challenges and opportunities of different IT-based approaches to green transitions presented in the course. Compare the different perspectives and approaches presented in the course through an empirical climate problem or case.

This situation has called for mitigation activities to be rolled out across numerous spheres of society. At the same time, digitalization appears to be rapidly increasing in many parts of the world, which means that the mitigation of climate change is difficult to imagine without digital technologies. The big question, then, is how digitalization can play an important and constructive role in creating the desired and necessary green transitions. In this course, students will be introduced to the work of a number of researchers affiliated with the ITU’s Center for Climate IT. The different researchers will present various perspectives on the grand challenges of connecting IT to green transitions. For example, computer scientists may address initiatives within machine learning and energy efficiency of algorithms and/or hardware interfaces, data scientists look at urban planning and mobility challenges, researchers within digital design may focus on designing ’green IT’ and influencing consumer behaviour and choices toward more climate-conscious ways of living (artefacts with climate biographies, responsible infrastructures, play, and AI), while social scientists may focus on the conceptual, organizational, infrastructural and managerial opportunities and challenges of digital technologies in relation to climate change mitigation as both a ’business problem’ and a societal problem. Bringing these different approaches and perspectives to bear in an inter- and cross-disciplinary setting affords the possibility of enriching our understanding of climate related problems and potential ways of addressing them.

At the heart of these discussions is the role that technologies, and in particular information technologies, play in globalising processes. With increasingly accelerated technological development people, goods, data, and ideas are now moving and working across more traditional territorial boundaries like never before. But with such an intensification of these processes come social, cultural, and political frictions. This course will provide students with a set of methodological and conceptual tools through which to engage with such frictions. With a particular focus on how global collaborations work in practice, students will learn to critically and reflexively approach the challenges and opportunities that emerge in collaborative settings. By engaging with a diversity of learning activities, including lectures, exercises, case work, and ethnographic writing, students will develop methodological procedures, analytical frameworks and critical reflection skills around IT-associated global collaborations.

This course provides a thorough introduction to the core aspects of machine learning, including models, training, evaluation, the underlying mathematical concepts and practical implementation. Key topics covered in the course include: Regression Classification Clustering Dimensionality Reduction This course is intended for students with a bachelor’s-level background in software development or a related field. A strong mathematical foundation is essential for understanding and interpreting machine learning concepts. Students will explore the mathematical models that underpin machine learning, approaching them from the perspective of machine learning itself. The necessary mathematic skills needed to understand fundamental machine learning will be developed progressively throughout the course and cannot be bypassed. No prior knowledge of linear algebra or calculus beyond Danish leval A mathematics is required. Throughout the course, the core concepts of model , learning , and evaluation in machine learning are developed beginning with foundational principles such as multi variate linear models, linear equations and optimization, supported by central topics of linear algebra like the definitions of linearity, linear combinations, affine, solutions to linear set of equations and basis. As the semester progresses, the course moves into more advanced material, such as non-linear approaches like neural networks and kernel methods, accompanied by non-linear optimization techniques. Through weekly exercises and a series of both smaller and larger mandatory assignments, students will gain hands-on experience applying the techniques covered in the course. Students will work with Python and standard libraries such as PyTorch and NumPy, applying these tools to diverse datasets. Image analysis and machine learning tasks will serve as the primary contexts for translating theory into practice. During the course, students will be expected to focus on: Understanding and applying mathematical concepts essential to machine learning models. The techniques to optimally estimating model parameters. Evaluating and benchmark models on specific problems. [if !supportLists] Interpretation of this includes: Explaining machine learning models mathematically and their practical implementations. Students will not have to reimplement existing advanced ML methods like KNN or neural networks; instead, the emphasis will be on describing, utilizing these algorithms effectively and evaluate them. Comprehend and articulate the mathematical underpinnings of models, how to optimally determine model parameters, select suitable machine learning models for problems, interpreting model outputs (like interpreting principal components), and evaluate and contrast model results. By the end of this course, students will be able to: Describe the key stages of the data modeling process, including data preparation, model development, evaluation, and communication of results. Explain essential machine learning concepts such as feature extraction, cross-validation, generalization, overfitting, prediction, and the curse of dimensionality. Outline how common data modeling methods function, including their underlying assumptions, mathematical underpinings and limitations. Identify and match real-world problems to standard machine learning tasks such as regression, classification, clustering and dimensionality reduction. Apply visualization techniques and statistical tools to assess model performance, uncover patterns, and detect data quality issues such as noise and filtering Adapt and combine data modeling tools to analyze a dataset of their choice and effectively communicate the findings. [if !supportLists] Detailed level: E xplain the concepts of model, model parameters, learning, and evaluation. Distinguish between linear, affine, and non-linear models and how the model parameters are inferred from data Understand and explain common loss functions including regularization Differentiate linear and non-linear optimization principles such as including linear and non-linear least squares, matrix inverse, pseudoinverse, and gradient descent. Apply selected linear algebra concepts, including matrix operations, transformations, inverse, determinant, solving linear equations, basis, and subspaces. Perform data wrangling, encompassing data transformations, normalization, standardization, filtering, and convolutions. Describe elementary multivariate statistics (mean, variance, correlation, covariance) and their application in machine learning. Calculate and explain multivariate differentiation and gradients, including their use in model optimization and the chain rule. Explain machine learning techniques like regression, classification, dimensionality reduction, and clustering, covering neural networks, support vector machines, principal component analysis, k-means, and mean-shift algorithms. Explain concepts like overfitting, underfitting, bias, variance, and bias-variance decomposition, including their link to regularization. Implement and explain evaluation metrics for machine learning models, including norms, confusion matrix, MCC, precision, and recall. Be able to program simple machine learning tasks on data on variable dimensionality and evaluations in Python utilizing standard packages such as Numpy, and PyTorch. Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites The course assumes that students are proficient in at least one imperative programming language (e.g., Java, Python, C, C++, or C#). Programming skills should be at the level expected after a Software development bachelor on the first semester of a computer science program The course builds on mathematical concepts, particularly in linear algebra. Meeting the general admission requirements for Computer Science or Software Development at SWU ensures that students have the necessary background that will be built upon. Specifically, the course presupposes knowledge equivalent to Level A high school mathematics and introductory discrete mathematics, including: • Vectors in 2D and 3D: dot (inner) product, cross product, angles, and distances • Differentiation of single-variable functions, including sum, product, and composition rules • Sums and sequences as covered in discrete mathematics • Basic descriptive statistics: mean, variance, median, mode, and histograms Preparation Advice Students are strongly encouraged to review the following topics before the course begins: • The distance formula and basic trigonometry • Vectors and vector operations • Rules of differentiation (e.g., chain rule) • Formulas for straight lines and polynomials To support this preparation, we recommend using the Book of Grasple modules, available via LearnIT, which provide targeted exercises on the prerequisite material. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Define, describe and relate concepts, mechanisms and mathematical models underpinning machine learning (ML) methods. Analyze and explain key aspects of constructing medium-sized machine learning applications.

Kurset er centralt, fordi ""wicked"" problemer oftest kræver anvendelse af kvalitative undersøgelsestilgange og -metoder til forstå problemet og til udvikling af løsninger. I den bredere sammenhæng bliver kvalitative undersøgelsesmetoder således en grundlæggende del af værktøjskassen af perspektiver og metoder, som eleverne akkumulerer i løbet af programmet. Den studerende er udstyret med en værktøjskasse med forskellige kvalitative undersøgelsestilgange, der kan anvendes i designforskning samt designpraksis. Derudover har den studerende fået erfaring fra at have anvendt nogle af disse tilgange i et kvalitativt studie oprettet i samarbejde med et igangværende forskningsprojekt og under tilsyn af forskere. Som en central del af kurset bliver de studerende trænet i formidling af deres arbejde skriftligt på engelsk. Den skriftlige kommunikation på engelsk er med til at forberede dem på et arbejdsliv, hvor det i mange tilfælde vil være det skrevne sprog.

Developing applications for mobile platforms presents a distinct set of challenges compared to desktop or server environments, due to constraints such as limited battery life, screen size, computational power, and storage. Mobile operating systems and programming models are therefore tailored to these constraints. While Android is used as the primary implementation platform in this course, the concepts and design principles taught are applicable across mobile platforms. This course teaches the fundamentals of mobile app design and development through a platform-agnostic lens, using Android and Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for hands-on implementation. The following topics will be introduced: core components of mobile platforms, such as activities, services, content providers, and broadcast receivers (with Android as the primary example) designing mobile app interfaces using declarative UI principles and Material Design working with local and remote data using files, on-device databases, and cloud services (Firebase) managing app lifecycle states and implementing concurrency and background work using Android-specific tools such as coroutines and WorkManager using device capabilities such as camera, sensors, microphone, and location services mobile/server communication including RESTful APIs, JSON, and Kotlin serialization creating context-aware and location-aware apps using Maps SDKs and geofencing mobile-specific AI using ML Kit and TensorFlow Lite security, app integrity, and deployment workflows including app signing, obfuscation, and application store submission Android’s threading and concurrency models are introduced and connected to broader principles of asynchronous programming and performance optimization.

You use them to describe systems concisely and with less errors. The goals of this course are achieved by introducing modeling languages and models as first class artifacts that are designed, manipulated, transformed and translated to code in an automatic fashion. Subjects will include : Domain-modeling, feature modeling, meta-modeling and design of domain specific languages Concrete Syntax, and concrete syntax editors Parsing with parser combinators Structural well-formedness and typing Semantics and implementation of domain-specific languages (interpreters, code generators) All programming is performed in Java or Xtend to enable common discussion, joint supervision and a shared learning process. However, the ideas can be realized in many programming languages. Use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed with restrictions during the exam (see LearnIT), as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines on generative artificial intelligence . Formal prerequisites You are a confident software developer, knowledgeable in programming language paradigms and concepts, able to work with (moderately) complex development projects yourself. These abilities can normally be obtained by following a Bachelor programme in software development. Object-oriented programming Classes and Interfaces Encapsulation Inheritance Polymorphism Generic Types Exceptions Java Basic data structures Lists, Trees and Graphs Basic complexity Software engineering Development Processes Quality Assurance Modeling (e.g., UML Class Diagrams) Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Perform domain analysis of a problem domain to define the scope of a language Design and implement a domain specific language Define semantics of simple operational and structural languages Describe and discuss the main techniques used for domain modeling and implementation (domain specific languages, modelling frameworks, interpreters, code generators, concrete syntax and models, type checkers) Manipulate abstract syntax representations programatically Design and improve concrete textual syntax for a modeling language.

This course aims at providing the computational tools to study these networks and form the basis of network scientists. The final objective is to have the students to solve practical network problems, to be able to perform a network analysis, and to fully appreciate the difficulties of a network problem in real-world data. The course will have a special focus on social networks.","Network science is a thriving field of study. The reason of its popularity is its ability to represent very complex phenomena with very simple models (graphs). With network science one can analyze: global societal patterns, catastrophic breakdowns of distributed infrastructures, the metabolic pathways in humans at the basis of diseases, among many examples.

You will get an in-depth understanding of how hardware and the operating system work; in the process, you will learn how computers actually work, and what actually happens at the lowest level when you run an application. This enables you to fully exploit underlying hardware and systems software to write high-quality software.","Behind every running application, there is systems software: software that provides a platform for other software. Examples include operating systems, scientific computing software, game engines, industrial control systems, and software as a service (SaaS). To write quality software that is e.g. correct, high performance, energy efficient, and exploiting hardware features, an application developer must understand how computer systems—hardware and systems software together—affects the behavior and performance of applications: they must understand the design, implementation, and implications, of computer systems. In this course, you study Operating Systems and C: the most important systems software and the most important systems programming language. You gain a deeper understanding of computer architecture (CPU, memory, etc.), of microarchitecture (ALU, MMU, PIC, registers, etc.), of how hardware runs software at the lowest level (ISA, Assembly, number representation), and of how high-level (C) code compiles (gcc) to low-level machine code (ELF). You get hands-on experience with build automation (make), with debugging machine code (gdb, valgrind), and with writing systems software in C. Finally, using C, you gain hands-on experience with high-performance programming utilizing compiler optimizations (e.g. loop unrolling, branchless programming) and hardware features (e.g. SIMD, multithreading, CUDA), with systems security (e.g. isolation, monitoring, side-channels, buffer overflows), and with interacting with the operating system through system calls (e.g. process- and thread-management, file- and network-I/O). To facilitate this, you will learn about fundamental operating system concepts (processes, virtual memory, files), other key systems concepts (caching, paging, pipelining, pointers, stack, heap, interrupts, concurrency, atomicity, locks), and how to use an operating system (shell, scripting, command-line, etc.). This course gives you a deep understanding of how computers work. This knowledge continues to benefit you throughout your career—also when programming in high-level languages like Java, C#, Python, and JavaScript—by revealing how those languages operate under the hood. This knowledge is essential for building high-quality software at top companies (think Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Samsung, etc.) for platforms ranging from embedded systems to cloud-based big data systems. Finally, if you aspire to contribute to the Linux kernel or other open-source projects, this course provides a strong and practical foundation. Ultimately, the goal is to enable you to fully exploit underlying hardware and systems software to write high-quality software.

In so doing, organization theories and concepts will be introduced along with concurrent organizational themes.","Organizations are both unavoidable in, and fundamental to, society. Classical organization theory was considered a practical and empirical science, something that in many cases was developed by organizational members to better understand, navigate, and advance the organizations within which they operated. Here, an organization was typically considered a delimited entity. Increasingly, however, organization scholars have directed their attention towards the processes through which organizations become what they are, focusing on the importance of how actors, technologies, documents, rules, things, and buildings, for instance, dynamically come together in the continuous formation of the organization. Thus, social practices may also be understood as organised activities and, therefore, something that takes place both within and outside formal organizations. The field of organization theory is very heterogeneous and has thrived dynamically, not least because of the proliferation of information technologies in enterprises and society. IT and digitalization, in other words, matter for organizations as well as for the development of organization theory. In this course and following Plesner and Husted’s book (2020) we think ‘organizationally’ about digitalization rather than 'digitally' about the organization. In so doing, we illuminate the sociomaterial dimension of organizations as a way to balance between the extreme ends of technological determinism and social constructivism. Concepts related to sociomateriality will be introduced and will help in developing a more dynamic understanding of the organization. Students will apply the theoretical concepts to understand, study, and analyze the multiple ways in which heterogeneous actors participate in the making of specific organizational themes. The course will situate concepts and perspectives by introducing contemporary themes, such as knowledge and datafication, legitimacy, empowerment, communication and more.

Formal prerequisites Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Identify and define key notions used to discuss philosophical and ethical problems related to digital design Combine theories to account for the IT-related problem that leads to philosophically or societally relevant consequences Discuss a philosophically relevant problem belonging to the domain of digital design Implement philosophical and ethical theories, reflect on the chosen problem, and present a formally and materially valid conclusion Ordinary exam Exam type: D: Submission of written work with following oral, External (7-point scale) Exam variation: D22: Submission with following oral exam supplemented by the submission. The course provides a basic introduction to philosophical and ethical problems related to digital design. The course puts a special focus on digitality, exploring its foundations, ontology, and ethical implications. New mandatory course for BDDIT 2026. Redesigned version of Philosophy of Science and Technology, DMD/B-DDIT (last offered Autumn 2024). The course provides the students with philosophical and ethical theories that allow for an understanding of the fundamentals and societal consequences of digital design. The literature introduces students to the ontological discussions on the nature of the digital realm, the aesthetic principles of digital design, and ethical approaches to computing. The course encourages students to reflect on the interrelationships between design, technology, and society. The objective of the course is thus to provide a set of coherent concepts for critical evaluation of the theoretical and methodological basis of digital design. It is also focused on possible consequences, ethical responsibility, and accountability of the creators.

"Courses/course_pages/Practical Concurrent and Parallel Programming, MSc CS (Autumn 2026) ｜ learnIT (27_10_2025 18：26：28).html","Practical Concurrent and Parallel Programming, MSc CS (Autumn 2026)",KSPRCPP2KU,This course is about that part of programming that focuses on parallelism and concurrency. It covers concurrency concepts that are universal to any programming language. The Java programming language is the main language used for practically addressing such aspects; and Erlang is also used for a topic in the course.,"Parallel and Concurrent Programming used to be an exception in the past: it is now the norm and all software systems are mostly made by several entities concurrently interacting with each other. Therefore, it is extremely important that computer science graduates acquire this knowledge. In this course you learn how to write correct and efficient concurrent and parallel software, primarily using Java, on standard shared-memory multicore hardware such as laptops, desktops and servers. The course covers basic mechanisms such as threads, locks and shared memory as well as more advanced mechanisms such as functional parallel stream operations, message passing, and lock-free data structures implemented using atomic compare-and-swap instructions. It covers concepts such as atomicity, safety, liveness and deadlock. It covers how to measure and understand performance and scalability of parallel programs. It covers tools and methods to find bugs in concurrent programs. The course places emphasis on how to reason about the correctness of concurrent programs. Topics covered include: Threads and locks in Java, shared mutable memory, mutual exclusion, deadlock, starvation, atomic operations, avoiding sharing (thread confinement), designing thread-safe classes, the monitor pattern. Visibility, volatile, immutable objects, final, the Java memory model. Functional programming, stream pipelines for bulk data, parallel operations on streams and arrays. Performance and scalability, performance measurements, scalability case studies: concurrent hashmap, parallel quicksort. Thread pools, the Java executor framework, work-stealing queues, Futures. Reasoning about correctness of concurrent programs, happens-before relation and linearizability Testing concurrent programs, safety and liveness properties, testing tools. Optimistic concurrency, lock-free data structures (lists, stacks and queues), compare-and-swap, progress concepts and how to implement a lock. Message passing concurrency, the internet protocols and the actors model using Erlang. Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites Students must know the Java programming language very well, including: inner classes, generics, a first exposure to threads and locks, and event-based graphical user interfaces.

As systems become more complex, developers need more than just intuition and manual checks. They need systematic ways to test and analyze programs to catch bugs and validate behavior. This course is all about giving you the tools, techniques and hands-on experience to just do that.","Modern developers must know not only how to write code, but also how to design appropriate, scalable test strategies and apply powerful analysis techniques to keep software reliable. We will cover key skills for building correct and high-quality software that eliminate subtle bugs and failures that surface often too late and need to be removed at high cost. This includes techniques such as property-based testing, symbolic execution, and fuzzing for reasoning about programs effectively and automatically exploring different behaviors. In the course, you will gain practical hands-on experience with modern testing and program analysis tools and techniques. You will learn how to generate high-quality test inputs automatically, explore program behavior systematically, and uncover bugs.

Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Identify applications of Bayesian analysis Formulate Bayesian Models Implement constructions of Bayesian Models using a probabilistic programming framework (PyMC) in Python Learn model parameters from data Explain differences between sampling algorithms, select, and use an appropriate inference algorithm Evaluate the models, inference, and learning queries experimentally Test your probabilistic programs Ordinary exam Exam type: D: Submission of written work with following oral, External (7-point scale) Exam variation: D1G: Submission for groups with following oral exam based on the submission. Shared responsibility for the report. Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming are believed to be the proper foundation for development and industrialization of next generation of AI systems. Bayesian statistics gives a well defined theoretical basis, that is analytically understandable, while probabilistic programming gives an instrument of automation, needed for proper industrialization of the method. This course introduces basics of Bayesian statistics, Bayesian data analysis, Bayesian learning, Bayesian Hypothesis testing, and the programming tools that enable automation of these methods. We will cover Bayesian reasoning and diagnosis and build models of concrete examples. We will learn several sampling methods and apply them to problems at hand. The course emphasizes programmable statistical methods over pen and pencil analytics. Every week we solve a programing exercise associated with the topic of the lecture. We will study Bayesian Analysis using an established textbook. For each chapter we will implement examples and exercises of models and analyses using Python's PyMC framework - probably the most popular probabilistic library today. Occasionally we will show examples of other probabilistic programming languages to illustrate concepts. Use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed with restrictions during the exam (see LearnIT), as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines on generative artificial intelligence . Formal prerequisites You need to be a confident programmer in the object-oriented programming style You should know basic probability theory at high-school level (concepts like discrete probability, or normal distribution). We will recall all the necessary notions in the course, but we will not provide a systematic course on probability theory. You may consider taking Linear Algebra and Probability in parallel, if you lack a systematic exposition to these topics. You should know Python, or be willing to learn it fast (learning Python fast is possible).

Dijkstra (1970);"" The predominant method developers use to ensure that software behaves as intended, is testing. However, no amount of testing can guarantee the absence of errors. While errors in business applications are often tolerated, the same cannot be said for software found in medical equipment, or for software used by aerospace and automotive industries. In such safety-critical systems, errors lead to significant monetary losses, destroyed equipment, even loss of life. In this course you learn how to write specifications of programs and prove, using state-of-the-art tools, that these programs follow their specification to the letter. You will write proofs in a similar way to how you write programs, and you will use interactive and automated proof assistants to check that all of your proofs are correct. Having a computer check your proofs in this way * significantly reduces the possibility of developer error, thus greatly improving the reliability of your software * enables you to update proofs of correctness in a similar iterative manner as you write programs---a sharp contrast to the error-prone task of maintaining and checking paper proofs. You will also learn the theoretical underpinnings required to make these tools function, giving you a solid understanding of how programs and their proofs of correctness are connected. This course is relevant for anyone with an interest in program correctness, as well as for mathematicians with an interest in ensuring that their pen-and-paper proofs are correct by having them checked by a computer. You will predominately be working with Coq. Coq is an industry-grade interactive proof assistant, used by Boeing, Airbus, Google, Facebook, BAE Systems, BedRock Systems, Ethereum, Galois, Trellix, and many others. Coq allows you to: * write and prove mathematical theorems * write programs and specifications in an embedded functional language called Gallina, prove properties about these programs, compile them to executable code, and run the verified programs * step through proofs one line at a time, similarly to a debugger, in order to modify and develop the proofs as you go along.

You will get in-depth experience with tools for this task, as well as an understanding of the theory behind them. This course thus equips you to pursue a career in writing safety-critical systems, or in pursuing higher studies in this area.","“Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!” ― Edsger W. Dijkstra (1970);"" The predominant method developers use to ensure that software behaves as intended, is testing. However, no amount of testing can guarantee the absence of errors. While errors in business applications are often tolerated, the same cannot be said for software found in medical equipment, or for software used by aerospace and automotive industries. In such safety-critical systems, errors lead to significant monetary losses, destroyed equipment, even loss of life. In this course you learn how to write specifications of programs and prove, using state-of-the-art tools, that these programs follow their specification to the letter. You will write proofs in a similar way to how you write programs, and you will use interactive and automated proof assistants to check that all of your proofs are correct.

It is intended for students with little or no prior experience with programming. The course teaches how to build games-related software using a game engine (Unity engine). The teaching emphasizes small programming exercises.,"Beyond the designated role of a programmer or a developer, the other roles in a game development team benefit from a basic understanding of programming. Programming skills are especially beneficial for designers whose ideas need to be clear, well-communicated, and, eventually, implementable. Understanding the basics of programming offers designers some of the necessary vocabulary to communicate with programmers and an insight into how programmers work and why they make certain decisions. Moreover, programming is an exciting and empowering tool for creative expression that offers designers new possibilities. It is beneficial that designers can create their own prototypes and software modifications even without a programmer. The course revolves around practical programming exercises preceded by basic programming concepts. The students will learn the core concepts related to game programming as well as the key features, tools, and structures of modern game engines. While the Unity game engine will be used in class, the concepts are explained in a way that makes them transferable to other contexts. During the course, the various hands-on programming exercises will help the students build their own portfolio of development projects.

Innovation is seen e.g. as a way in which to save the welfare state, and innovation guides the allocation of major investments in research and development across the private and public sectors on both a national and international level. Therefore it is important to be able to both constructively and critically engage with innovation in both theory and practice. Reassembling innovation will provide students with a range of theoretical perspectives and methodological tools to constructively and critically address innovation. Along with the theoretical exploration, emphasis will be also given on the organizational strategy and design within open ecosystems. In this emerging era of decentralization and networked collaboration, reassembling the pieces of innovation is an imperative for all types of organizations (private, public, NGOs and social enterprises). The course will, among other things, enable students to reflect upon your own role as active participant in future technological and societal developments, as well as to reflect on the politics and values embedded in the design and use of technologies. The course will address topics such as Innovation models, innovation in science and technology, performativity of innovation science and models, innovative commons, organizational design in distributed innovation systems, critique of innovation, employee driven innovation, scaling innovation, innovation & politics. Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances.

Shared responsibility for the report. Students will collaborate with industrial partners on projects that are relevant to the industry and provided by these partners. They will experience what it is like to work on a real industrial project in a setting as realistic as possible. They will apply in practice all the software engineering skills they have learned in their earlier courses, while also learning new technologies. Student groups will learn to apply Scrum, one of the agile frameworks, in practice by performing several short iterations in their projects. Each group of 7–9 students will be supported by a product owner from the industrial partner, a Scrum master enrolled in a master-level elective course, and an agile coach from the industry. Semester Layout. The course will be divided into four blocks. In the first block, weeks 1 and 2, you will be involved in the formation of the groups and the matchmaking with the industrial partners. During the second block, weeks 3 and 4, you will kick off the project with your Scrum team. Finally, in the third block, weeks 5 to 17, you will run six two-week sprints and participate in two feedback sessions. The course will conclude with a final week of submissions, demos, and celebrations before the exam session.

Courses/course_pages/Sketching (Autumn 2026) ｜ learnIT (27_10_2025 18：29：56).html,Sketching (Autumn 2026),BASKITS1KU,"The course introduces students to sketching as an attitude and approach in a design and development process of interactive technologies. The course offers techniques to develop sketches in different formats and dimensions (2d, 3d, 4d), and as such enables students to express and develop ideas through various modes of externalization and at various stages of a design process. It asks students to reflect on the influence of the sketching method in a larger design process.","Sketching is central to any process of design. It refers to the externalization of often vague ideas and their manifestation in the world. This manifestation can play multiple roles, and in this course, it is particularly conceptualized as a mode of thinking on the one hand and to express a design intention on the other. The course will provide students with a multitude of sketching techniques and asks students to explore their utility in a design process. The course will primarily work with pen and paper sketches and will introduce sketching methods within different dimensions, such as perspective drawing, moodboarding, storyboarding, clay modelling, overlaying, and vector based rendering. The course work will be centered around a simple design exercise in which the different sketching techniques are employed. The exam deliverable asks students to present a curated workbook of sketches and reflect on the qualities of sketching in their design process on both a general and technique specific level. No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances.

Courses/course_pages/Society & Technology (Autumn 2026) ｜ learnIT (27_10_2025 18：30：12).html,Society & Technology (Autumn 2026),BBSOTEC1KU,The overall aim of the course is to enable students to understand and analyse relations between society and technology.,"Society and technology are often considered as separate entities. Some scholars have viewed technologies as neutral instruments enabling people to act more efficiently. Others have criticised technologies for dehumanising or alienating humans from each other or from nature. Increasingly, however, it is understood that technologies are neither neutral, nor good or bad, but are inseparable from organisational, social, political and economical contexts. Social research points to the mutual shaping of technology and society, and the transformative relationship between social organisation and technology. People design, build, and support technological systems. Technologies transform human identity, culture, politics, and imagination, as well as shape everyday work practices in global organisations. This course introduces a range of critical approaches to technology. The course will provide an analytical toolkit to understand, study and analyse the multiple ways in which information technologies participate in our social, organisational and cultural lives. Engaging with a diverse set of global technologies and critical themes, the course explores the relationships between society and technology. Examples include: Technopolitics: what forms of politics are embedded within technologies, and how do technologies produce political effects, Climate Technologies: how do particular technologies mediate climate knowledges and effects, Technology, Race and Gender: how do technologies reproduce assumptions about race and gender, and what are the consequences?, and questions of how these analytical sensitivities can be applied to contemporary issues such as Surveillance or Security. Through an analysis of these questions, the course offers a basic introduction to new perspectives on the relationship between technology, society and human practice. The course will include: A historical perspective to consider the past, present and future in our engagement with technology; critical perspectives from social studies of science and technology; and social and cultural approaches to the changing relations between humans and machines. NB: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites There are no formal prerequisites for this course.

"Courses/course_pages/Software Ecosystems - combining user centered design, organisational and technical dimensions (Autumn 2026) ｜ learnIT (27_10_2025 18：30：36).html","Software Ecosystems - combining user centered design, organisational and technical dimensions (Autumn 2026)",KSSOECO1KU,"Today we rarely use programs that are developed to fit one specific customer. When we play games, use business systems for administration, or download apps to our phones, we use software that is part of software ecosystems: software products that are configured to fit a specific business context; platforms like game engines that allow the development and sharing of software ; or software as a service. Examples of software ecosystems have developed around software products, like game engines, or enterprise resource planning (ERP or CRM) software, integrated development environments like visual studio and platforms like the Android operating system. In this course you explore software ecosystems from UX design, organizational and technical perspectives. To this end you will analyse a software ecosystem together, propose an improvement related to the ecosystem, and support your proposal with a prototype and / or other design artefacts. Description Most of the software we use is not developed specifically for one organisation, but for groups of customers and users. Software provided as a service likewise is developed for a generic usage that needs to be configured and tailored to the specific needs of customers and users. To understand the evolution of such software products and platforms, it is not enough to look at the individual piece of software. Not taking into account the interaction between different actors – ranging from the provider of the core product or platform to consultancies configuring the software, customers and users – will result in the software becoming obsolete, or customers and users searching for alternatives. The providers of software products and platforms need to strike a balance between genericity and specificity: The generic design, on the one hand, allows to provide powerful functionality, on the other hand, it constrains the possibilities for adaptation to the specific context. Many software products therefore allow for ‘design in use’ through tailoring and configuration by the end users. The course explores software ecosystems from three perspectives: The UX Design perspective focuses on the possibilities and constraints software products and platforms provide for the user. Many of the software products open up for End User Development, allowing – to a certain extend – the design-in-use of the software. The course will also explore the constraints that the usage of software products put on the embedment of the software in concrete work practices. The course will further explore how UX design is used to inform the product management in software ecosystems and the means of users to influence the direction in which the software ecosystem develops. The organizational and business perspective explores the governance and economic viability of software ecosystems. How can we describe the interaction between the business models of different stakeholders in the ecosystem? How can we analyze business models for software ecosystems, which typically involve multiple actors? We will explore governance structures that have (been) developed to deliberate decisions on new features and change of the underpinning architecture. Another topic will be innovation processes in software ecosystems: What can companies learn about needs and already implemented solutions by the end-user? The software engineering perspective explores the technical design and development processes in software ecosystems. The course discusses the technical side of End User Development, that means different approaches to defer design decisions by providing tailoring and configuration interfaces or relying on the customization through consultancies or local developers. We explore how the ongoing and continuous evolution of the products and platform as well as their customisation affect software processes. This also includes the analysis of life site data to understand user needs and preferences and drive the development. Research centered lectures will be complemented with guest lectures from industry experts. The plan is to invite at least two guest lectures for each of the three perspectives. The theoretical part of the course, consisting of lectures, guest lectures and readings will be complemented by a project where student teams first analyse a software ecosystem using methods and tools presented in the course and, during the second half of the course, design on an improvement, add on, or service based on the software ecosystem, which should be supported by a prototype and / or other design artefacts. The teams are expected to discuss the readings together. Use of generative AI during the exam: No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites The course is offered under the Computer Science M.Sc. program but is an elective for all other M.Sc. programs at the IT University as well. There are no formal prerequisites other than a B.Sc. degree, but the students should study one of the M.Sc. programs at the IT University. Computer Science and Software Design students might benefit from having taken the software architecture course. Students studying Digital Innovation and Management might benefit from having taken service design and innovation management courses. For Digital Design students having read the design driven innovation course and taking the service design specialization can be beneficial. From the Games program, students who are interested in the integration of game design, construction and the business based on them might benefit most from the course. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Describe and explain the concept of software ecosystem and related core concepts (such as actors, business models, architecture, and governance mechanisms). Analyse a software ecosystem from a technical, organizational, business and design perspective. Discuss and relate the analysis of a concrete software ecosystem to current research on software ecosystems. Show how technical design and development, organizational structures and business models, user centered design and end-user development mutually depend on each other. Identify challenges in the design and evolution of software product and platform ecosystems taking these three dimensions into account and offer suggestions for how these challenges can be addressed.

Show how technical design and development, organizational structures and business models, user centered design and end-user development mutually depend on each other. Identify challenges in the design and evolution of software product and platform ecosystems taking these three dimensions into account and offer suggestions for how these challenges can be addressed. Discuss where and how the Software Ecosystem context challenges conventional design and development processes, methods and techniques. Ordinary exam Exam type: D: Submission of written work with following oral, External (7-point scale) Exam variation: D2G: Submission for groups with following oral exam supplemented by the submission. Shared responsibility for the report. Most of the software we use is not developed specifically for one organisation, but for groups of customers and users. Software provided as a service likewise is developed for a generic usage that needs to be configured and tailored to the specific needs of customers and users. To understand the evolution of such software products and platforms, it is not enough to look at the individual piece of software. Not taking into account the interaction between different actors – ranging from the provider of the core product or platform to consultancies configuring the software, customers and users – will result in the software becoming obsolete, or customers and users searching for alternatives. The providers of software products and platforms need to strike a balance between genericity and specificity: The generic design, on the one hand, allows to provide powerful functionality, on the other hand, it constrains the possibilities for adaptation to the specific context. Many software products therefore allow for ‘design in use’ through tailoring and configuration by the end users. The course explores software ecosystems from three perspectives: The UX Design perspective focuses on the possibilities and constraints software products and platforms provide for the user. Many of the software products open up for End User Development, allowing – to a certain extend – the design-in-use of the software. The course will also explore the constraints that the usage of software products put on the embedment of the software in concrete work practices. The course will further explore how UX design is used to inform the product management in software ecosystems and the means of users to influence the direction in which the software ecosystem develops. The organizational and business perspective explores the governance and economic viability of software ecosystems. How can we describe the interaction between the business models of different stakeholders in the ecosystem? How can we analyze business models for software ecosystems, which typically involve multiple actors? We will explore governance structures that have (been) developed to deliberate decisions on new features and change of the underpinning architecture. Another topic will be innovation processes in software ecosystems: What can companies learn about needs and already implemented solutions by the end-user? The software engineering perspective explores the technical design and development processes in software ecosystems. The course discusses the technical side of End User Development, that means different approaches to defer design decisions by providing tailoring and configuration interfaces or relying on the customization through consultancies or local developers. We explore how the ongoing and continuous evolution of the products and platform as well as their customisation affect software processes. This also includes the analysis of life site data to understand user needs and preferences and drive the development. Research centered lectures will be complemented with guest lectures from industry experts. The plan is to invite at least two guest lectures for each of the three perspectives. The theoretical part of the course, consisting of lectures, guest lectures and readings will be complemented by a project where student teams first analyse a software ecosystem using methods and tools presented in the course and, during the second half of the course, design on an improvement, add on, or service based on the software ecosystem, which should be supported by a prototype and / or other design artefacts. The teams are expected to discuss the readings together. No use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed at the exam under any circumstances. Formal prerequisites The course is offered under the Computer Science M.Sc. program but is an elective for all other M.Sc. programs at the IT University as well. There are no formal prerequisites other than a B.Sc. degree, but the students should study one of the M.Sc. programs at the IT University. Computer Science and Software Design students might benefit from having taken the software architecture course. Students studying Digital Innovation and Management might benefit from having taken service design and innovation management courses. For Digital Design students having read the design driven innovation course and taking the service design specialization can be beneficial. From the Games program, students who are interested in the integration of game design, construction and the business based on them might benefit most from the course. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Describe and explain the concept of software ecosystem and related core concepts (such as actors, business models, architecture, and governance mechanisms). Analyse a software ecosystem from a technical, organizational, business and design perspective. Discuss and relate the analysis of a concrete software ecosystem to current research on software ecosystems. Show how technical design and development, organizational structures and business models, user centered design and end-user development mutually depend on each other. Identify challenges in the design and evolution of software product and platform ecosystems taking these three dimensions into account and offer suggestions for how these challenges can be addressed.

Description New Special Topic / Specialisation course for KDDIT 2024 Interaction design is the discipline where humans and computers meet. It frames how we interact with an increasingly digitalized world, as well as how we relate to one another. This course imagines and creates new forms of interaction and applications for computing based on a particular topic each semester. It uses a combination of methods, materials, and mediums from HCI, design, and art to develop new things that make arguments or claims about how things might be done differently, with an eye towards producing preferable futures. This course will cover interaction design methods and theory through both in-class examples as well as a design project in groups. Over the course of the semester, groups will develop an interactive artefact or set artefacts in response to a design brief they produce. This design process will be informed by research that roots the brief in a particular situation and context, with a particular audience in mind. Students will have the opportunity to engage in a complete design process from requirements gathering through to prototyping, while developing methodological and theoretical capacities to express intentionality as part of a practice based in use, societal context, and/or art. All use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed during the exam, as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines on generative artificial intelligence . Formal prerequisites Students should have completed KDDIT course Advanced Design Processes (or the equivalent) and an introductory-level programming course. Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: Compare and apply advanced theories, methods, and tools for analysing interactive qualities across physical and digital products and applications.

It focuses on designing different forms of communication correctly, effectively, and convincingly. There will be a theoretical introduction to the importance and principles of technical communication together with several individual and group based practical exercises.","To succeed in life, you need to be able to communicate in an efficient and convincing manner. Your ability to communicate technical topics will play a deciding role whether you get a job, a promotion, win a grant, or whether your start-up succeeds. Research shows that no matter what job you have, whether you are a manager in a big company, a researcher, or a data-scientist, you will spend at least 20 percent of your time on communication. Much of this time will be spent on communicating technical insights to non-technical audiences (e.g. team members, upper management, investors, journalists, policy makers). As such, poor communication can lead to major financial losses or even to serious catastrophes costing human lives. In this course the student will gain an understanding of why technical communication is important, and how to communicate technical information clearly, efficiently, and convincingly to different audiences and through different formats. We will focus on communicating verbally and through written text. In particular, the course will cover the following subjects: Challenges and failures of communication Importance and principles of technical communication Rhetoric principles Team-based communication Audience analysis and subject research Communicating correctly, effectively, and convincingly Designing and delivering persuasive technical presentations Text design and reviewing, evaluating, testing documents and websites Summarizing research findings, communication for web and social media Translating research findings for a general audience Writing definitions, documentation and instructions Use of generative AI during the exam: All use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed during the exam, as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines on generative artificial intelligence .

Digital technologies are transforming both internal work and management practices and the relation between welfare professionals and citizens. Understanding these processes of transformation and what they entail is crucial for working both in public sector with digitalization and e.g. as consultant in the private sector. This course provides theoretical tools and empirical insights into how public sector transformations take place and unfold in practice, with a focus on the Danish public sector. The course goes into depths with the 'how' of public sector digitalization: How are digitalization processes changing the landscapes and ecosystems of the public sector today, and which types of hopes, dreams and challenges are involved in these processes? The course consists of three main elements: Thematic focus : How are digitalisation processes changing and challenging the welfare state? How are local governmental institutions, welfare encounters, work, professions, and management practices changed by digitalization? Concepts and method : How do we study and make sense of the changing organisational practices of the Danish welfare state? Project work : Grouped in research teams, you will conduct ethnographic research projects in local governmental settings going through processes of digitalization. The course prepares and equips you to work at the forefront of public sector transformations. As part of the course, you will carry out your own group research project in a Danish governmental setting. Doing so, you will study the implementation and/or changes caused by digitalization, linking your empirical work to core theoretical concepts in the course. This project work will, furthermore, provide you with inspiration, method and theory reflections, empirical insights and analytical skills relevant for your master thesis as well as future employment. Use of generative AI during the exam: Use of generative artificial intelligence is allowed with restrictions during the exam (see LearnIT), as long as the student follows the official ITU guidelines on generative artificial intelligence. Formal prerequisites This course constitutes the second part of the specialisation in Public Digitalisation. ITU students may apply to include the course in an individual specialisation . Single subject and guest students may register for this course without participating in the first part of the specialisation. The course presupposes a basic knowledge of sociological theories of society Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: - Describe, analyse and engage with the challenges of digitalization of the Danish public sector - or with ties to Danish public sector digitalization – in research and in organisational practice. - Plan and conduct their own exploratory inquiry into an empirical case related to public sector digitalisation through an iterative process of problem formulation, data collection and analysis. - Apply selected methods and conceptual tools to analyse their own empirical data and cases. - Critically reflect on and discuss the decisions made in the research process and the relationship between the chosen methods, theories and data, and their implications for the findings.

The course presupposes a basic knowledge of sociological theories of society Intended learning outcomes After the course, the student should be able to: - Describe, analyse and engage with the challenges of digitalization of the Danish public sector - or with ties to Danish public sector digitalization – in research and in organisational practice. - Plan and conduct their own exploratory inquiry into an empirical case related to public sector digitalisation through an iterative process of problem formulation, data collection and analysis. - Apply selected methods and conceptual tools to analyse their own empirical data and cases. - Critically reflect on and discuss the decisions made in the research process and the relationship between the chosen methods, theories and data, and their implications for the findings. Ordinary exam Exam type: D: Submission of written work with following oral, External (7-point scale) Exam variation: D2G: Submission for groups with following oral exam supplemented by the submission. Shared responsibility for the report. The course consists of three main elements: Thematic focus : How are digitalisation processes changing and challenging the welfare state? How are local governmental institutions, welfare encounters, work, professions, and management practices changed by digitalization? Concepts and method : How do we study and make sense of the changing organisational practices of the Danish welfare state? Project work : Grouped in research teams, you will conduct ethnographic research projects in local governmental settings going through processes of digitalization. The course prepares and equips you to work at the forefront of public sector transformations. As part of the course, you will carry out your own group research project in a Danish governmental setting. Doing so, you will study the implementation and/or changes caused by digitalization, linking your empirical work to core theoretical concepts in the course. This project work will, furthermore, provide you with inspiration, method and theory reflections, empirical insights and analytical skills relevant for your master thesis as well as future employment.

Adgangen til personlige data, kunstige intelligencer og overvågning er tydelige eksempler. Bevidstgørelse, og evnen til at forstå, artikulere og arbejde med værdier og etik i design er en helt central design kompetence, og bliver i stigende grad en afgørende del af vores design repertoire. Nye teknologier vil åbne uendelige muligheder, og en afgørende diskurs i teknologidesign er derfor, ikke om vi kan, men om vi skal. Design er intentionel forandring af verden, og er derfor en dybt etisk og værdiladet praksis, hvad enten vi ser det eller ej. Udviklingen af en ansvarlig design praksis kræver derfor både indsigt, forståelse og metoder til kvalificeret at behandle de etiske og værdimæssige aspekter af design, både for den individuelle designer, teamet, organisationer og de lokale/globale kontekster vi designer til og for. På dette kursus vil de studerende lære at blive bevidst om hvordan man arbejder med etik og værdier i design og innovationsprocesser. Gennem både teoretiske reflektioner og praktiske værdi og etik fokuserede design metoder vil de studerende lære at tage ansvar for at se, arbejde med og artikulere hvilke værdier der træder i forgrunden i deres design proces. De studerende vil opbygge en forståelse af hvordan teknologier både forstærker og reducerer menneskers værdier og handlinger og derfor spiller en afgørende rolle for både sociale sammenhænge, social og miljømæssig bæredygtighed, virksomheder og demokrati. På kurset vil vi udarbejde både et ordforråd og metode katalog der vil gøre de studerende i stand til at arbejde eksplicit med værdier og etik i design processen, og i forskellige design kontekster, både kvalificeret og intentionelt. Kurset vil tilbyde de studerende en mulighed for at styrke en helt central del af deres design repertoire, et aspekt der både nu og i fremtiden vil være en efterspurgt kompetence i design og udvikling af nye teknologier. Ingen brug af generativ kunstig intelligens er tilladt til eksamen.
