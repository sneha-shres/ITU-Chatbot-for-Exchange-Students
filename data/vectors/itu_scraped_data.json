E.g. if you are on a bachelor programme you can only apply for courses at bachelor level.If you want to take courses at another university in the future as a part of your degree at the IT University, you must apply for a pre-approval. You can only apply for pre-approval of courses at the same level as your own programme. E.g. if you are on a bachelor programme you can only apply for courses at bachelor level. Be aware that aside from applying for pre-approval from ITU, you also need to follow the guidelines for admission, if you are taking the courses at other Universities. Look for admission rules for guest students or exchange students on their website. If your courses are to be part of an individual specialisation, remember you need to apply for an individual specialisation, and not just the pre-approval. The deadline is every 1st of the month throughout the year (July not included) How does it work?This means that all applications received up until (as an example) March 1 will be processed during March. The reply to the application will then follow around first of April (the standard processing time being 4 weeks.) Apply in good time?If you want to apply in good time, then aim at applying for Autumn courses already during Spring. And vice versa apply for Spring courses during the autumn semester leading up.For Individual specialisations be aware of thisKeep in mind that you will need to have the approval, to be able to register for a specific course the coming semester. Therefore apply in good time with regards to the registration periods. Find them here An approved specialisation does not guarantee you a spot on the course.

Therefore apply in good time with regards to the registration periods. Find them here An approved specialisation does not guarantee you a spot on the course. How to apply Fill out the application form Make a provisional study plan Include the relevant documentation: Link to course descriptions including the number of credits awarded for the course Course title and course code (add an English course title to be used on your final ITU diploma). Conversion to ECTS (if the course is not in ECTS). Please add a link to document how the conversion is made. Link to where the level of the course is documented (BSc or MSc). Students on Master and Diploma (part time programmes) will also have to submit documentation that they have had two years of full-time work experience prior to following the course. This is NOT a requirement for BSc and MSc students. You must enclose documentation as links (e.g. to a university’s course catalogue). Make sure that links are stable. You do not need to send us ITU-Diplomas or course descriptions for ITU-courses. We only need documentation from other universities. Send the application to Student Affairs and Programmes at sap@itu.dk. The handling of your application begins after the deadline. It involves different tasks in order to secure the academic output for you, when taking courses outside of ITU. This involves evaluating and comparing the courses that are listed for pre-approval, to guarantee that it matches you programme. Because different people are involved at different times, and because of the amount of applications we normally receive, the processing time is 4 weeks. We always work hard to have a reply for you as soon as possible. Useful informationHow to convert credits to ECTS when studying abroadIf the course(s) you want to have pre-approved are not ECTS-based, you must document how many credits/points/units cover a full time semester at the foreign university. For example: University X requires 120 credits to obtain a bachelor degree. The bachelor degree takes 8 semesters to complete (4 years). Hence, 120 credits is divided by 8 semesters, which is equal to 15 credits pr. semester.After you have passed the pre-approved coursesThe pre-approval of courses is a preliminary approval. It is not the actual transfer of credits from another educational institution. You must submit documentation of passed and non-passed courses that have been pre-approved by the university. You should do this as soon as you receive a transcript of your records. Send the documentation along with the original pre-approval letter from Student Affairs and Programmes by email to sap@itu.dk. If you are not going to use your pre-approvalYou must notify the IT University if you are not using your pre-approval, as you must be registered for study activities at the IT University instead. If you forget to tell us, the pre-approval will block you from registering for other courses.

You must send the complaint within two weeks from the day you received the decision. No matter who you are complaining to you send the complaint in an email to sap@itu.dk and we will direct it to the department responsible. It can take up to 4 weeks processing your application.

Some courses are mandatory, some you chose as electives and for some electives you can decide to convert the ECTS into an elective project. Mandatory Courses Some modules are filled with mandatory courses. Mandatory courses are courses that you have to take at specific points in a specific order during the course of your studies. The courses are often divided into lectures or class teaching and following exercises. 1st semester students are administratively registered for their mandatory courses on their first semester, but from there on students need to register for their mandatory courses in the registration periods. Electives Some modules are reserved for electives. Electives are courses that you decide on yourself but you must choose electives that are within the objectives of your programme. You can use an elective to steer your studies towards your individual interests, to inspire you for future projects or to supplement future specialisations.

Study activities are specific courses and projects that can fill out a module, and in order to fulfill the requirements in your curriculum, you must fill out all modules. The study activities that are available can change each semester, but the modules are always available. Some courses are mandatory, some you chose as electives and for some electives you can decide to convert the ECTS into an elective project. Mandatory Courses Some modules are filled with mandatory courses. Mandatory courses are courses that you have to take at specific points in a specific order during the course of your studies. The courses are often divided into lectures or class teaching and following exercises. 1st semester students are administratively registered for their mandatory courses on their first semester, but from there on students need to register for their mandatory courses in the registration periods. Electives Some modules are reserved for electives. Electives are courses that you decide on yourself but you must choose electives that are within the objectives of your programme. You can use an elective to steer your studies towards your individual interests, to inspire you for future projects or to supplement future specialisations. Special academic prerequisites?For some students their educational background might qualify them for courses outside the course list. Please read more here Courses to choose from You choose from the course list in LearnIT. The courses are all approved as electives for your programme . The courses are considered to be within the curricula of your programme and they are chosen from the perspective that the majority of students on the programme will have the basic qualifications to succeed on the course.

Useful information concerning coursesThe Course CatalogueYou can find descriptions of the current courses in the course catalogue in LearnIT / All courses. From October/April, you will be able to see a list of course titles for the coming semester. Full descriptions of the courses are available in November/May[date may be changed].Semester length and LearnITTeaching runs from Monday in week 5 and 35. Each course is taught for 14 weeks, though the course periods run for either 15 or 16 weeks, depending on bank holidays. The details for each course are available through LearnIT one week before the semester starts at the latest. You must be registered for a course in order to access it.Mandatory activitiesCourses may have mandatory activities that you need to pass in order to sit for the exam. Descriptions of the mandatory activities are available in the course base.Course evaluationsEach semester, you evaluate all your courses. You have ample possibility of sharing your opinion in the three-step course evaluation during each course. ECTS and workloadOne ECTS corresponds to 27.5 hours of work for the students which is in line with the official Bologna process A 7.5 ECTS course therefore represents around 206 hours of activity in total. It is difficult to be more specific when speaking about all courses, but it serves as a basis for calculation. Assuming it will take 40 hours to prepare for exam in a 14 week course, this leaves an average of 11.8 work hours per week in those 14 weeks. Projects Project work is an important part of the MSc programme. It offers the opportunity to delve deeper into specific areas that interest you or your project group. Project work also allows for a more in-depth engagement with case organisations. There are different kinds of projects on a MSc programme: Thesis (30 ECTS). Learn more about the Thesis Individual projects / Elective projects (7,5 or 15 ECTS). Summer Projects (7,5 or 15 ECTS). Projects as part of a course You can use elective modules for writing a project under supervision, rather than taking an elective. You register for the project in the registration period.

Mandatory Courses Some modules are filled with mandatory courses. Mandatory courses are courses that you have to take at specific points in a specific order during the course of your studies. The courses are often divided into lectures or class teaching and following exercises. 1st semester students are administratively registered for their mandatory courses on their first semester, but from there on students need to register for their mandatory courses in the registration periods. Electives Some modules are reserved for electives. Electives are courses that you decide on yourself but you must choose electives that are within the objectives of your programme. You can use an elective to steer your studies towards your individual interests, to inspire you for future projects or to supplement future specialisations.

Each course is taught for 14 weeks, though the course periods run for either 15 or 16 weeks, depending on bank holidays. The details for each course are available through LearnIT one week before the semester starts at the latest. You must be registered for a course in order to access it.Mandatory activitiesCourses may have mandatory activities that you need to pass in order to sit for the exam. Descriptions of the mandatory activities are available in the course base.Course evaluationsEach semester, you evaluate all your courses. You have ample possibility of sharing your opinion in the three-step course evaluation during each course. ECTS and workloadOne ECTS corresponds to 27.5 hours of work for the students which is in line with the official Bologna process A 7.5 ECTS course therefore represents around 206 hours of activity in total. It is difficult to be more specific when speaking about all courses, but it serves as a basis for calculation. Assuming it will take 40 hours to prepare for exam in a 14 week course, this leaves an average of 11.8 work hours per week in those 14 weeks. Projects Project work is an important part of the MSc programme. It offers the opportunity to delve deeper into specific areas that interest you or your project group. Project work also allows for a more in-depth engagement with case organisations. There are different kinds of projects on a MSc programme: Thesis (30 ECTS). Learn more about the Thesis Re project (7,5 ECTS) Individual projects / Elective projects (7,5 or 15 ECTS). Summer Projects. (7,5 or 15 ECTS) Projects as part of a course You can use elective modules for writing a project under supervision, rather than taking an elective. You register for the project in the registration period. You can chose to work on your own project entirely, collaborate with a company or do a group project. Re Project The re project is intended as the bridge between your specialisation and your thesis. It allows you to focus very narrowly and in great detail on the particular sub-topics of your specialisation that will then be used in your thesis. The re project is formally a project like any other, however, we do offer some help and guidelines for finding a supervisor. The content of the project is not limited, but is intended to feed into your thesis. The re project very often takes the form of a narrowly focused literature study or a prototype implementation or use of particular software tools. See here for more information about the Re Project Specially for KCS- and KSD-students studying abroad If you are going abroad in the semester just before writing your thesis, you can take an elective abroad instead of writing the Re Project – preapproval for the elective is still necessary. Additionally, you are recommended to attend the Re Project Introduction meeting at ITU in week 35. The introduction meeting will is informative with regards to the Master thesis as well. If this is not possible then check up on the general information about the Re project, since it also shares details about the thesis. (See link just above)",

The courses are considered to be within the curricula of your programme and they are chosen from the perspective that the majority of students on the programme will have the basic qualifications to succeed on the course. Always check the pre-requisites However, it is always important to check the prerequisites and course descriptions for courses approved and offered. Some courses belong to a different study programme and they can require specific knowledge you might not have. In order to follow a course and sit for the exam, you must register for the course in the registration period. Each programme consists of modules and study activities. Study activities are specific courses and projects that can fill out a module, and in order to fulfill the requirements in your curriculum, you must fill out all modules. The study activities that are available can change each semester, but the modules are always available. Some courses are mandatory, some you chose as electives and for some electives you can decide to convert the ECTS into an elective project. Some modules are filled with mandatory courses. Mandatory courses are courses that you have to take at specific points in a specific order during the course of your studies. The courses are often divided into lectures or class teaching and following exercises. 1st semester students are administratively registered for their mandatory courses on their first semester, but from there on students need to register for their mandatory courses in the registration periods. Some modules are reserved for electives. Electives are courses that you decide on yourself but you must choose electives that are within the objectives of your programme. You can use an elective to steer your studies towards your individual interests, to inspire you for future projects or to supplement future specialisations. Special academic prerequisites?

Useful information concerning coursesThe Course CatalogueYou can find descriptions of the current courses in the course catalogue in LearnIT / All courses. From October/April, you will be able to see a list of course titles for the coming semester. Full descriptions of the courses are available in November/May[date may be changed].Semester length and LearnITTeaching runs from Monday in week 5 and 35. Each course is taught for 14 weeks, though the course periods run for either 15 or 16 weeks, depending on bank holidays. The details for each course are available through LearnIT one week before the semester starts at the latest. You must be registered for a course in order to access it.Mandatory activitiesCourses may have mandatory activities that you need to pass in order to sit for the exam. Descriptions of the mandatory activities are available in the course base.Course evaluationsEach semester, you evaluate all your courses. You have ample possibility of sharing your opinion in the three-step course evaluation during each course. ECTS and workloadOne ECTS corresponds to 27.5 hours of work for the students which is in line with the official Bologna process A 7.5 ECTS course therefore represents around 206 hours of activity in total. It is difficult to be more specific when speaking about all courses, but it serves as a basis for calculation. Assuming it will take 40 hours to prepare for exam in a 14 week course, this leaves an average of 11.8 work hours per week in those 14 weeks. Projects Project work is an important part of the MSc programme. It offers the opportunity to delve deeper into specific areas that interest you or your project group. Project work also allows for a more in-depth engagement with case organisations. There are different kinds of projects on a MSc programme: Thesis (30 ECTS). Learn more about the Thesis Re project (7,5 ECTS) Individual projects / Elective projects (7,5 or 15 ECTS). Summer Projects. (7,5 or 15 ECTS) Projects as part of a course You can use elective modules for writing a project under supervision, rather than taking an elective. You register for the project in the registration period. You can chose to work on your own project entirely, collaborate with a company or do a group project. Re Project The re project is intended as the bridge between your specialisation and your thesis. It allows you to focus very narrowly and in great detail on the particular sub-topics of your specialisation that will then be used in your thesis. The re project is formally a project like any other, however, we do offer some help and guidelines for finding a supervisor. The content of the project is not limited, but is intended to feed into your thesis. The re project very often takes the form of a narrowly focused literature study or a prototype implementation or use of particular software tools. See here for more information about the Re Project Specially for KCS- and KSD-students studying abroad If you are going abroad in the semester just before writing your thesis, you can take an elective abroad instead of writing the Re Project – preapproval for the elective is still necessary. Additionally, you are recommended to attend the Re Project Introduction meeting at ITU in week 35. The introduction meeting will is informative with regards to the Master thesis as well. If this is not possible then check up on the general information about the Re project, since it also shares details about the thesis.

      "Before the examPreparation for online examThis is a recommended minimum list to aid you prepare the exam. Technical Install Zoom on your computer Use an external microphone if you have one. They are usually better than built-in ones Ensure in advance that you have working web camera, microphone and internet connection Invite a fellow student to test equipment including speaker, microphone and setup with you in good time Install the latest Zoom app on a mobile device with data subscription in case of technical issues and weak or unstable connections Practical Practice your exam in Zoom to be familiar with the environment Arrange in advance how you will handle writing/drawing during the exam if needed. Get inspiration and useful advice on annotation with Zoom, whiteboard in zoom, sharing ipad screen for drawing in Zoom from these video tutorials regarding Zoom Place yourself so you have a balanced backlight so others can see you better. Avoid sunlight from the sides and back. Group exams Unless your teacher decides otherwise and communicates this at the latest 7 days before the group exam, students attending a group exam are allowed to be in the same room during the exam. The ITU recommendation is that students who are in the same room during a group exam log onto Zoom individually using their own device and mute their microphone when they do not speak in order to avoid feedback loop Security - online oral examsAll online oral exams take place on Zoom.

      "During the examGuidelinesThese guidelines were approved by Board of Studies 5 May 2020: Students and examiners must have the camera on during the entire examination (except when sharing screen as this setting does not allow using the camera at the same time) in order to make the online exam as close as possible to ordinary face-to-face exams. Having the camera permanently on also is a measure for the examiners to evaluate if students are cheating. Examiner starts the exam and goes through how the meeting will proceed. The identity of the student must be established. If asked by the examiners, student must show student card. ITU trusts that students adhere to the exam rules and that students do not receive any help during the exam. If asked by the examiners, student must show the room they are located in. The student can display a background picture to maintain privacy. E.g. this one of ITU. During presentation it is recommended that non-speakers microphones are unmuted. The examiner ends the exam when the time has expired and makes sure that students are not attending the voting. If any unforeseen incidents happen, it is a good idea to describe and document what happened. According to the Examination Order, audio or video recording of an exam is not allowed unless the recordings are part of the examination. In such cases, the University undertakes the recording. The recording must thus not take place if the sole aim is to use the recording in the case of an exam complaint or to reveal cheating. How to make the online conversation run smoothly Speak as clearly as possible Wait a little bit longer for people to finish sentences so you don't risk interrupting them Acknowledge what other people are saying with nods, not confirming sounds or words as the risk disturbing the speaker Raise your hand so others can see you want to say something Consider using Zoom's push-to-talk function to avoid broadcasting unintended noise. The Push to Talk feature allows you to remain muted throughout your Zoom meeting and hold down the spacebar when you want to be unmuted and talk Join the Zoom meeting Log on to the Zoom meeting using the link provided in LearnIT by your teacher/supervisor If you have technical issues, use the Zoom app on your mobile phone to join the meeting If the Zoom app on your phone does not work either, you can call the meeting via phone using the Zoom Dial-in number provided by your teacher/supervisor The exam itself Once joining the meeting, you will be automatically placed in a waiting room. To access the examination room, you will be invited in by the examiner You say your name and authenticate yourself. If asked by the examiners, you must show student ID card Depending on the exam there will be a method for drawing of exam question - not relevant for all exams You present Your teacher and the external examiner ask questions For answers requiring different tools to e.g., write code, draw a diagram, etc.: Share your screen (see tutorial) Use the shared whiteboard in Zoom With regards to writing code, you will be allowed to use the Integrated Development Environment of your choice With regards to drawing diagrams, you will be allowed to use the tool of your choice as long as this does not become a reason for delays. In case of delays or if you prefer, you will be allowed to draw diagrams on a sheet of paper that is afterwards shown to the camera Once the exam is completed, the examiner will place you in a Zoom breakout room Stay online and await in another Zoom breakout room while your teacher and external examiner discuss your performance The examiner invites you back into the exam breakout room for the result Group exams Like it is the case for face-to-face exams, students can ask to get their grade without the presence of the fellow students.What happens if there a technical issues? If the internet connection or camera fail: Install the Zoom app on your phone before the exam so you can move to a mobile device if needs be. Call the meeting via phone using the Zoom Dial-in number provided by your teacher/supervisor If you have problems with your WIFI connection: Use cable instead Place yourself close to the router Turn off other devices that use the router (streaming of film, music, etc.) It can be a solution to log on from two devices. Remember to move both devices between the Zoom breakout rooms. Also remember to mute one device (otherwise potential doom of feedback loop). No video - only audio If you experience issues with video but is still available to attend with audio, the examiners assess whether there is a risk of cheating or if the exam can be carried through with only audio. If one of the examiners experiences issues with video, the exam is carried through, unless the examiner depends on video to pursue the examination. Extension of exam If the duration of the interruption caused by technical problems corresponds to less than 1/5 of the exam, the examiner adds the time spent re-establishing communications to the exam.",

Your talk will also focus more specifically on the information required for the application: 3rd step: Documentation When applying it is important to enclose documentation of your disability. Depending on the disability in question, this may be: The documentation should ideally include a description and recommendation detailing what you can or cannot, and what you will need for the exam.

Remember for applying you will need to book a meeting with the SPS counsellor. Autumn semester October 1 for ordinary exam 2nd Wednesday in February for re-exam Spring semester March 1 for ordinary exam 2nd Wednesday in July for re-exam Exams outside the usual termsA small amount of exams are held outside the usual terms for ordinary exams and re-exams - usually in April or October. If you are applying for special conditions for one of these exams, the deadline is four weeks before the beginning of the exam. Exams outside the usual terms If you can document a disability, ITU has set the following general conditions that you can get for the exams. If you need special examination conditions that are beyond the general conditions, you need to include relevant documentation for this in your application. Please note that as a general rule, ITU does not allow use of electronic devices at the exam. Written exams on premises Written exams - Take Home Projects: assignment + oral exam (all projects including the thesis) Specifically for the Bachelor and Thesis oral exams (in case of dyslexia) If your special needs relate to a change of the exam form, this needs to be discussed explicitly with the SPS student counsellor at the meeting. Exam forms generally cannot be changed If you want to apply for a change of exam form, you must apply for the specific exam and for each semester If your medical documentation recommends a change in the exam form, the course manager and the head of study programme will decide if the recommended change is in alignment with the intended learning outcomes of the course.",

Preferably, matching your expectations will prevent a situation where you will have to file a complaint. How to complainPlease fill out the complaint form, and submit it to Student Affairs and Programmes, by emailing it to sap@itu.dk. Depending on the character of your complaint, Student Affairs and Programmes will forward your complaint to the Head of Programme or the relevant manager. Note that your complaint will not result in a re-assessment of your exam or project. Please fill out the complaint form, and submit it to Student Affairs and Programmes, by emailing it to sap@itu.dk.

If you need your title for the project changed you need to write to sap@itu.dk. The title in STADS is the title that will go on your diploma. This goes for the supervisor as well. If you registered with a project description and your project has changed, you are not able to update it on the project page. The problem statement though can be added and edited until the formal deadline. Afterwards you cannot edit it. Important If you and your supervisor agree, you can implement any change you want in the actual project. Your project description or problem statement will not be part of the assessment. If you have substantial changes to the problem statement, method or the like, you may want to describe them in an appendix or a summary about the project process in the finished project.Courses: File size and typesIt is up to the Course manager to decide if students are allowed to upload 1 or 5 files, in LearnIT when submitting a course assignment. All students need to check the exam activity on LearnIT for information about this. The standard is that students can upload up until 5GB and all file types are allowed. If there are any restrictions it will say so on the course description in LearnIT. Also, to make sure your files do not exceed the maximum permitted, you can compress them in a .zip file. Here is a walk-through how to do that.Projects: File size and typesFor a project the standard file size has a maximum of 100MB. The different types of files can be: .odt,.pdf,.rtf,.docx,.doc,.pptx,.ppt,.html,.htm,.sxw,.txt Besides the one file that is the project you are able to upload 5 appendices, with a maximum size of 2GB for each. Always check the exam activity in LearnIT, when in doubt. Also, to make sure your files do not exceed the maximum permitted, you can compress them in a .zip file. Here is a walk-through how to do that. You must not upload files that are protected, i.e. password protected or encrypted. Can I submit after the deadline?No, the system will close down for any uploads after the deadline. You can apply for an exemption to hand in after the deadline, but it needs to be on the basis of Special circumstances If you want to apply, you should send the application as soon as possible and attach the assignment to the email. Remember to argue why you should be exempted. Also see above, if you did not hand-in due to problems related to uploading in LearnIT. If you do not submit within the deadline or if your application for exemption is rejected, a \"not attended\" (udeblevet) will be registered for the exam. Can I replace a submitted assignment/project with a newer version?At first, you will upload a draft. You can edit the draft or submit it. Once you have submitted, you cannot edit your submission. You can apply for an exemption from the rule, but this will often have to be on the basis of special circumstances. Do all group members have to upload a copy?When you submit an assignment as a group, you should upload the project just once. Any member of the group can upload the project, and he or she must add the other group members in the submission window in LearnIT.Should I submit a blank sheet, if I can't submit any work?No, you shouldn't submit anything. You will get a \"u\" for \"udeblevet\" (absent). It can mistakenly be registered as a submission for the exam, if you submit a blank sheet.What if my work is confidential?When you submit in LearnIT, you can choose to make the submission \"confidential\" and only the examiners will be able to see it. You can ask if the oral examination can be held behind closed doors, but kindly note that it’s up to the examiners if they accommodate your requests. Please use the possibility of confidentiality with care, as important knowledge sharing will be lost if it is used too often.",

This goes for students that experience difficulties such as dyslexia and stammering as well. It can vary from student to student how much support is needed and whether the support is only focused on exams or a more general support via aids or both. Please see the detailed information about Special Educational support here. A common need when struggling with challenges or barriers that relate to an impairment, diabetes or a neurodivergence, can be the need for special conditions at an exam. The possibility is given to ensure that you are able to demonstrate your knowledge and competences regardless of your given situation. Please note Exam anxiety in it self is not considered as a disability in this context.Therefore it will not result in special conditions at your exam. An exam on special conditions must be both practically possible and reasonable and must not lower the general academic standard or level of exam. You can book a meeting with the SPS student counsellor as soon as you are confirmed admitted to your Programme. The sooner the better. How to apply1st step: Book a meeting with the SPS counsellorBefore applying for special conditions for the exam you need to book a meeting with the SPS student counsellor at SPS@itu.dk.

If you are applying for special conditions for one of these exams, the deadline is four weeks before the beginning of the exam. Exams outside the usual terms If you can document a disability, ITU has set the following general conditions that you can get for the exams. If you need special examination conditions that are beyond the general conditions, you need to include relevant documentation for this in your application. Please note that as a general rule, ITU does not allow use of electronic devices at the exam. Written exams on premises Written exams - Take Home Projects: assignment + oral exam (all projects including the thesis) Specifically for the Bachelor and Thesis oral exams (in case of dyslexia) If your special needs relate to a change of the exam form, this needs to be discussed explicitly with the SPS student counsellor at the meeting. Exam forms generally cannot be changed If you want to apply for a change of exam form, you must apply for the specific exam and for each semester If your medical documentation recommends a change in the exam form, the course manager and the head of study programme will decide if the recommended change is in alignment with the intended learning outcomes of the course.",

      "Each programme consists of modules and study activities. Study activities are specific courses and projects that can fill out a module, and in order to fulfill the requirements in your curriculum, you must fill out all modules. The study activities that are available can change each semester, but the modules are always available. Some courses are mandatory, some you chose as electives and for some electives you can decide to convert the ECTS into an elective project. Mandatory Courses Some modules are filled with mandatory courses. Mandatory courses are courses that you have to take at specific points in a specific order during the course of your studies. The courses are often divided into lectures or class teaching and following exercises. 1st semester students are administratively registered for their mandatory courses on their first semester, but from there on students need to register for their mandatory courses in the registration periods. Electives Some modules are reserved for electives. Electives are courses that you decide on yourself but you must choose electives that are within the objectives of your programme. You can use an elective to steer your studies towards your individual interests, to inspire you for future projects or to supplement future specialisations. Special academic prerequisites?For some students their educational background might qualify them for courses outside the course list. Please read more here Courses to choose from You choose from the course list in LearnIT. The courses are all approved as electives for your programme .

      "SU - highlightsSU in generalOne month of SU counts as one grant portion (1 “klip”). The overall SU is divided into up to 70 grants portions which equals 70 months of SU. This means that for a higher education you can receive SU for 70 months. The 70 grants portions equal 6 years of studies (5 years and 10 months). Please note that from January 2027 the overall amount of SU will be up to 58 grant portions for all SU recipients admitted after 1 July 2025 (except for recipients of supplementary grant for physically or mentally disabled and single parent providers). Read about the SU reform at SU’s website here. SU is transferred to your NemKonto account, and you are in charge of registering which account is your NemKonto. You receive your SU in advance. For example, you will be receiving your SU for the month of November already at the end of October. Please be aware of the SU-reform that is put into action January 1, 2027. All students enrolled Autumn 2025 or later will be effected by this. Read more hereHow much SUWhen you start your education, you will be granted SU corresponding to your study programme’s standard duration in months. If you are admitted to your first higher education course no later than two years after having completed your qualifying exam, you will receive SU to the standard duration of the education + 12 extra grant portions. These extra grant portions can be used if you are delayed in your studies or you change your study programme. Important: On January 1 2027, these 12 extra grant portions will be removed with the commencement of the SU-reform. Extending your frame for SU For students with a professional bachelor’s degree (professionsbachelor) with a duration of more than 3 years, or a BSc programme with propedeutics, please look up the possibilities for expanding the frame for your SU.  SAP at SAP@itu.dk and let us know that you have a professional bachelor’s degree. Deadlines when applying You can apply for SU one month before the month where you qualify for SU at the earliest. If you can receive SU from September, you can apply at the earliest August 1. If your programme starts after the 20th in a month, you are not entitled to SU for that month. The deadline for applying for SU for e.g. the month of August is August 31. The deadline for applying for SU for the month of December is December 5. If you apply after this, you will receive SU from January at the earliest. Important: We recommend that you wait a couple of days, from accepting your place on your programme, until you apply for SU. Then we will have registered your programme which makes it easier for you to apply for SU. SU and your residence statusIt is your registered address on the first day of the month that determines your status, and which rate you can receive in State educational grant (SU). The rate depends on whether you are registered at the same address as your parents or not. Your residence status is automatically and continuously determined based on information input from the CPR-register. If you move away from home, but have already received SU as living at home that month, your SU grant will retroactively be adjusted, so you will receive the amount corresponding to the rate for living away from home. This can take 1-2 weeks. You will find information about your residence status at SU’s website here.

In situational questions, you are asked how you will solve a difficult issue or circumstance related to the job with the aim of uncovering your analytical and problem-solving skills, while behavioural questions will focus on your previous actions and performance in certain settings. 5. Elaborate on your answers It is not enough to state that you have the needed qualifications; you need to demonstrate that you possess them. You will want to have a few anecdotes on hand to nail this part. If you state that you are a team player, elaborate with a personal example of a situation that shows you as a team player. Share how you handled the situation, and what impact it made. By making descriptive answers, you help the interviewer to understand you better. 6. Brainstorm on your questions Questions are an essential way of demonstrating your interest in the position and future colleagues. Even if you do not have any questions, think of a few.

      "Each programme consists of modules and study activities. Study activities are specific courses and projects that can fill out a module, and in order to fulfill the requirements in your curriculum, you must fill out all modules. The study activities that are available can change each semester, but the modules are always available. Some courses are mandatory, some you chose as electives and for some electives you can decide to convert the ECTS into an elective project.

The deeper the understanding you have of the course content, the better you remember it. Also, try to connect the new knowledge in the course with what you already know. This way, the knowledge will be integrated, and you will remember it better.

E.g. if you are on a bachelor programme you can only apply for courses at bachelor level.If you want to take courses at another university in the future as a part of your degree at the IT University, you must apply for a pre-approval. You can only apply for pre-approval of courses at the same level as your own programme. E.g. if you are on a bachelor programme you can only apply for courses at bachelor level. Be aware that aside from applying for pre-approval from ITU, you also need to follow the guidelines for admission, if you are taking the courses at other Universities. Look for admission rules for guest students or exchange students on their website. If your courses are to be part of an individual specialisation, remember you need to apply for an individual specialisation, and not just the pre-approval. The deadline is every 1st of the month throughout the year (July not included) How does it work?This means that all applications received up until (as an example) March 1 will be processed during March. The reply to the application will then follow around first of April (the standard processing time being 4 weeks.) Apply in good time?If you want to apply in good time, then aim at applying for Autumn courses already during Spring. And vice versa apply for Spring courses during the autumn semester leading up.For Individual specialisations be aware of thisKeep in mind that you will need to have the approval, to be able to register for a specific course the coming semester. Therefore apply in good time with regards to the registration periods. Find them here An approved specialisation does not guarantee you a spot on the course.

Therefore apply in good time with regards to the registration periods. Find them here An approved specialisation does not guarantee you a spot on the course. How to apply Fill out the application form Make a provisional study plan Include the relevant documentation: Link to course descriptions including the number of credits awarded for the course Course title and course code (add an English course title to be used on your final ITU diploma). Conversion to ECTS (if the course is not in ECTS). Please add a link to document how the conversion is made. Link to where the level of the course is documented (BSc or MSc). Students on Master and Diploma (part time programmes) will also have to submit documentation that they have had two years of full-time work experience prior to following the course. This is NOT a requirement for BSc and MSc students. You must enclose documentation as links (e.g. to a university’s course catalogue). Make sure that links are stable. You do not need to send us ITU-Diplomas or course descriptions for ITU-courses. We only need documentation from other universities. Send the application to Student Affairs and Programmes at sap@itu.dk. The handling of your application begins after the deadline. It involves different tasks in order to secure the academic output for you, when taking courses outside of ITU. This involves evaluating and comparing the courses that are listed for pre-approval, to guarantee that it matches you programme. Because different people are involved at different times, and because of the amount of applications we normally receive, the processing time is 4 weeks. We always work hard to have a reply for you as soon as possible. Useful informationHow to convert credits to ECTS when studying abroadIf the course(s) you want to have pre-approved are not ECTS-based, you must document how many credits/points/units cover a full time semester at the foreign university. For example: University X requires 120 credits to obtain a bachelor degree. The bachelor degree takes 8 semesters to complete (4 years). Hence, 120 credits is divided by 8 semesters, which is equal to 15 credits pr. semester.After you have passed the pre-approved coursesThe pre-approval of courses is a preliminary approval. It is not the actual transfer of credits from another educational institution. You must submit documentation of passed and non-passed courses that have been pre-approved by the university. You should do this as soon as you receive a transcript of your records. Send the documentation along with the original pre-approval letter from Student Affairs and Programmes by email to sap@itu.dk. If you are not going to use your pre-approvalYou must notify the IT University if you are not using your pre-approval, as you must be registered for study activities at the IT University instead. If you forget to tell us, the pre-approval will block you from registering for other courses.

If your syllabus contains difficult literature (for example of a highly technical, philosophical or mathematical nature) which requires time to understand, your syllabus for a project can be reduced. If you develop a product as part of your project, the teacher can reduce the syllabus as appropriate.",
      "Especially for these programmesEspecially for GAMESThe general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for the GAMES study programme. Because of the inherent interdisciplinarity of the programme, the syllabus is often a mix of technical papers, other academic articles and books. A suitable guideline is that all reports should cite at least as many sources as they have pages. If students develop a product as part of a project or exam assignment, the supervisor can reduce the syllabus as appropriate. Especially for SWU, DS, SD and CSThe general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for SWU, DS, SD & CS study programmes. This is because syllabus on these programmes often contains a lot of coding and very little text. Coding has a very compressed nature compared to text. This applies for both courses, exam assignments and projects. Supervisor/course manager decide the syllabus for these study programmes.",

Standard page and body size Bachelor project and thesis When writing a project, always agree with your supervisor on how much you should read and write. Your supervisor has the final word on the workload, page limit and syllabus for your project, depending on the scope and distribution between re, production and writing in your work. On this page, you can find guidelines that can form the basis of your alignment of expectations with your supervisor. The rule of thumb for minimum syllabus in projects is 500 pages + 300 additional pages per 7.5 ECTS. Examples: This guideline is extremely flexible depending on the subject area and educational level. If your syllabus contains difficult literature (for example of a highly technical, philosophical or mathematical nature) which requires time to understand, your syllabus for a project can be reduced. If you develop a product as part of your project, the teacher can reduce the syllabus as appropriate. Especially for these programmesEspecially for GAMESThe general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for the GAMES study programme. Because of the inherent interdisciplinarity of the programme, the syllabus is often a mix of technical papers, other academic articles and books. A suitable guideline is that all reports should cite at least as many sources as they have pages. If students develop a product as part of a project or exam assignment, the supervisor can reduce the syllabus as appropriate. Especially for SWU, DS, SD and CSThe general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for SWU, DS, SD & CS study programmes. This is because syllabus on these programmes often contains a lot of coding and very little text. Coding has a very compressed nature compared to text. This applies for both courses, exam assignments and projects. Supervisor/course manager decide the syllabus for these study programmes. Especially for these programmes The general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for the GAMES study programme. Because of the inherent interdisciplinarity of the programme, the syllabus is often a mix of technical papers, other academic articles and books. A suitable guideline is that all reports should cite at least as many sources as they have pages. Especially for SWU, DS, SD and CS General rules How much you need to write depends on the subject area and on the balance between text and the development of a product or other practical work. Therefore, you agree upon how much you need to write with the supervisor based on what is appropriate in your specific case. Standard page and body sizeA standard page is 2,400 units per page, including spaces and notes. The standard page range indicated on this page refers to the body of the written work.

It is not the actual transfer of credits from another educational institution. You must submit documentation of passed and non-passed courses that have been pre-approved by the university. You should do this as soon as you receive a transcript of your records. Send the documentation along with the original pre-approval letter from Student Affairs and Programmes by email to sap@itu.dk.

E.g. if you are on a bachelor programme you can only apply for courses at bachelor level.If you want to take courses at another university in the future as a part of your degree at the IT University, you must apply for a pre-approval. You can only apply for pre-approval of courses at the same level as your own programme. E.g. if you are on a bachelor programme you can only apply for courses at bachelor level. Be aware that aside from applying for pre-approval from ITU, you also need to follow the guidelines for admission, if you are taking the courses at other Universities. Look for admission rules for guest students or exchange students on their website. If your courses are to be part of an individual specialisation, remember you need to apply for an individual specialisation, and not just the pre-approval. The deadline is every 1st of the month throughout the year (July not included) How does it work?This means that all applications received up until (as an example) March 1 will be processed during March. The reply to the application will then follow around first of April (the standard processing time being 4 weeks.) Apply in good time?If you want to apply in good time, then aim at applying for Autumn courses already during Spring. And vice versa apply for Spring courses during the autumn semester leading up.For Individual specialisations be aware of thisKeep in mind that you will need to have the approval, to be able to register for a specific course the coming semester. Therefore apply in good time with regards to the registration periods. Find them here An approved specialisation does not guarantee you a spot on the course.

Therefore apply in good time with regards to the registration periods. Find them here An approved specialisation does not guarantee you a spot on the course. How to apply Fill out the application form Make a provisional study plan Include the relevant documentation: Link to course descriptions including the number of credits awarded for the course Course title and course code (add an English course title to be used on your final ITU diploma). Conversion to ECTS (if the course is not in ECTS). Please add a link to document how the conversion is made. Link to where the level of the course is documented (BSc or MSc). Students on Master and Diploma (part time programmes) will also have to submit documentation that they have had two years of full-time work experience prior to following the course. This is NOT a requirement for BSc and MSc students. You must enclose documentation as links (e.g. to a university’s course catalogue). Make sure that links are stable. You do not need to send us ITU-Diplomas or course descriptions for ITU-courses. We only need documentation from other universities. Send the application to Student Affairs and Programmes at sap@itu.dk. The handling of your application begins after the deadline. It involves different tasks in order to secure the academic output for you, when taking courses outside of ITU. This involves evaluating and comparing the courses that are listed for pre-approval, to guarantee that it matches you programme. Because different people are involved at different times, and because of the amount of applications we normally receive, the processing time is 4 weeks. We always work hard to have a reply for you as soon as possible. Useful informationHow to convert credits to ECTS when studying abroadIf the course(s) you want to have pre-approved are not ECTS-based, you must document how many credits/points/units cover a full time semester at the foreign university. For example: University X requires 120 credits to obtain a bachelor degree. The bachelor degree takes 8 semesters to complete (4 years). Hence, 120 credits is divided by 8 semesters, which is equal to 15 credits pr. semester.After you have passed the pre-approved coursesThe pre-approval of courses is a preliminary approval. It is not the actual transfer of credits from another educational institution. You must submit documentation of passed and non-passed courses that have been pre-approved by the university. You should do this as soon as you receive a transcript of your records. Send the documentation along with the original pre-approval letter from Student Affairs and Programmes by email to sap@itu.dk. If you are not going to use your pre-approvalYou must notify the IT University if you are not using your pre-approval, as you must be registered for study activities at the IT University instead. If you forget to tell us, the pre-approval will block you from registering for other courses.

You must send the complaint within two weeks from the day you received the decision. No matter who you are complaining to you send the complaint in an email to sap@itu.dk and we will direct it to the department responsible. It can take up to 4 weeks processing your application.

      "Can I edit the project page?The information that has travelled from when you registered is not editable on the project page in LearnIT. If you need your title for the project changed you need to write to sap@itu.dk. The title in STADS is the title that will go on your diploma. This goes for the supervisor as well. If you registered with a project description and your project has changed, you are not able to update it on the project page. The problem statement though can be added and edited until the formal deadline. Afterwards you cannot edit it. Important If you and your supervisor agree, you can implement any change you want in the actual project. Your project description or problem statement will not be part of the assessment.

Study activities are specific courses and projects that can fill out a module, and in order to fulfill the requirements in your curriculum, you must fill out all modules. The study activities that are available can change each semester, but the modules are always available. Some courses are mandatory, some you chose as electives and for some electives you can decide to convert the ECTS into an elective project. Mandatory Courses Some modules are filled with mandatory courses. Mandatory courses are courses that you have to take at specific points in a specific order during the course of your studies. The courses are often divided into lectures or class teaching and following exercises. 1st semester students are administratively registered for their mandatory courses on their first semester, but from there on students need to register for their mandatory courses in the registration periods. Electives Some modules are reserved for electives. Electives are courses that you decide on yourself but you must choose electives that are within the objectives of your programme. You can use an elective to steer your studies towards your individual interests, to inspire you for future projects or to supplement future specialisations. Special academic prerequisites?For some students their educational background might qualify them for courses outside the course list. Please read more here Courses to choose from You choose from the course list in LearnIT. The courses are all approved as electives for your programme .

ECTS and workloadOne ECTS corresponds to 27.5 hours of work for the students which is in line with the official Bologna process A 7.5 ECTS course therefore represents around 206 hours of activity in total. It is difficult to be more specific when speaking about all courses, but it serves as a basis for calculation. Assuming it will take 40 hours to prepare for exam in a 14 week course, this leaves an average of 11.8 work hours per week in those 14 weeks. Projects Project work is an important part of the MSc programme. It offers the opportunity to delve deeper into specific areas that interest you or your project group. Project work also allows for a more in-depth engagement with case organisations. There are different kinds of projects on a MSc programme: Thesis (30 ECTS).

Do not insert links to the documents directly in the e-mail. Documentation attached in other formats may prolong the processing time of your application.

You still need to register Please note Pre-approval of courses How it worksIt is only when you register for the 2nd part of the specialisation, that it officially becomes your specialisation. You sign up for the courses in the registration period in My Study Activities. It is only when you register for the 2nd part of the specialisation, that it officially becomes your specialisation. You do not register for a specialisation, but you register for and pass the individual courses on the given specialisation. Some courses might have prerequisites, so be sure to check those in the course base. See your specialisation options under Your Programme / Specialisations See here for the details about how to register If the specialisation options do not meet your specific demands or ambitions, you can also apply for an individual specialisation. If your application is approved, you still need to register for the courses! An individual specialisation must meet the same official requirements as the predetermined specialisation. As the specialisation normally leads to the thesis, you need to ensure a progression within the individual specialisation. A specialisation is in total 22.5 ECTS except for Games where the specialisation is 30 ECTS. How to applyTo apply for an individual specialisation you have to make a provisional study plan and fill out an application form where you need to: List the courses you want for your individual specialisation Describe the content of the courses (and project), how they supplement each other, and why they are in an academic progression Elaborate on how the individual specialisation fits in with the rest of your curriculum Describe your motivation for applying for the specific specialisation and why the courses you wish to take cannot be your elective study activities? Explain how the specialisation may lead you to and prepare you for writing your master thesis Send it to sap@itu.dk.

This will not only help you qualify your chosen specialisation but also make it more understandable for the assessors. Only for CSAn individual specialisation is only possible if you are going on exchange. Any other scenario you pick the courses you want from the pool of specialisation courses offered.

Apply well before the course registration starts, so you have a fair chance of receiving our decision, and act according to it. You cannot register for the courses on your individual specialisation before the individual specialisation is approved. Read more about registration for courses. If your application for an individual specialisation only has to do with the second part of your specialisation, ‘in due time’ still just means in time for you to be able to receive our decision and register for the specific course in the registration period. Remember that it can take up to four weeks to process the application. If your individual spesialisation is approved, it does not mean that you are automatically registered for the course(s). The decision is purely an academic assessment of the study activity and of the curriculum you are enrolled on. You still need to register for the course(s) on equal terms with all other students.

It is not enough to demonstrate that you have a huge theoretical knowledge within specific areas; you must be able to explain what you are capable of with your educational and work related backgrounds. It is not always an easy task to describe what you have learnt from your courses and projects, or what you have learnt performing your student job. Start by looking in the curriculum of your study programme. Here, you will fidn a list of the competencies hou have developed while studying your degree. When you want to find out what skills you have, it is important that you broaden your thinking. It is not just about your academic competencies from your education or your student job. We develop valuable sklils in virtually all aspects of our lives, and the art is to uncover all these skills and put them into words, which employers can understand. One way to clarify your sklils is simply to make a brainstorm. Group your skills into three groups: Your personal competencies, your professional competencies and your general competencies. Exercise: Download \"Knowing Your Competencies\" If you are a recent graduate without many professional skills, it may be a good exercise to think your educational programme through: what courses did you take? What methods have you learned? did you use different study methods along the way (group work, special exam forms, field work etc.)? Write down everything in a list, so you can sort and systematize if afterwards. If you have work experience, you may want to use the same method. For each job you have had, you can ask yourself some questions: which assignments have you been solving within each function? What working methods and techniques have you used? What subject areas have you learned? Which results have you helped to achieve? E.g. language skills: what languages do you know? How wide and deep is your knowledge (can you read, write, speak and understand the language, and at what level?) E.g. IT: which programs do you know, and at what level? You can also have many other general skills. One way to describe the general skills can be to make a list of the activities you do in your spare time. It can be sports, hobbies, memberships of associations, politics, board work and so on. Try to look at what you actually do in these activities. The Career Center at The University of Southern Denmark has made some videos (only in Danish) about how to clarify your competencies when preparing for your job - you can find inspiration here.",

Below you’ll find some valuable knowledge and practical guidelines to consider when you process personal data as a student at ITU. WHAT IS PERSONAL DATA? Personal data is any kind of information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person and may include: • Name, address, phone number, e-mail etc. (regular personal data) • Information about racial or ethnic origin, political, religious and philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status, sexual orientation and biometric data (sensitive personal data) • CPR numbers are considered regular personal data but also confidential information.

If you process personal data (by gaining access or collecting) e.g. in a project, assignment, master's thesis etc., we recommend you to consider the following 4 main areas: Collecting When you collect personal data to be used in a project etc., it is always advisable to obtain a consent from the individuals that the data relates to. Storing Personal data should be handled in a safe manner. This means that you must store it in a way that is not available to the public, e.g. at unsecured places. Sharing As a rule, you are only allowed to share personal data if you have a legal basis (e.g. consent) to do so. If the sharing of personal data is part of the project, you must be certain that the people with whom you share the data will handle the data in a safe manner. If it is possible to anonymise the personal data before sharing it, we strongly recommend that you do so. Deleting Delete all personal data when it is no longer necessary for you to keep it.

If you do not pass your exam using the three attempts, you can apply for a fourth exam attempt, if special circumstances has led to the situation.The first-year examAs a bachelor student you must pass a minimum of 45 ECTS of your first-year courses by the end of your first year of study. If you do not meet this requirement, you will not be allowed to continue your studies at ITU without an exemption. ITU can grant you an exemption from the above-mentioned deadline if there are special circumstances. Therefore, if you have been prevented from following courses and/or taking exams due to special circumstances, you can apply for an exemption. If you are granted an exemption, the deadline for when you must have passed a minimum 45 ECTS of your first-year courses will be by the end of your second year of study. If you have credits transferred from previous studies to your ITU programme, these credits will not count as part of the fulfilment of the first-year exam. More information about the first-year exam.The maximum programme durationThe Bachelor of Science (BSc) programme must be completed within four years for students enrolled autumn 2015 or later. The Master of Science (MSc) programme must be completed within three years for students enrolled in autumn 2015 or later. If you due to special circumstances cannot complete your education within the maximum programme duration, you will need to apply for an exemption to postpone the deadline for when you must have completed your education.The progression requirementThe progression requirement states how much you have to pass each year in order to be considered an active student. From 1 September 2025, you must pass one exam within a continuous period of one year, corresponding to two consecutive semesters, including re-exams. If you do not do this, you will not be allowed to continue your programme and your enrolment will be terminated. In this context, it is irrelevant how many exam attempts you have used. If you due to special circumstances cannot fulfil the progression requirement, you can apply for an exemption from this rule. Calculating the one-year period In case you have been granted leave of absence, this period is excluded when calculating the one-year period. Any credit transfer from courses taken prior to admission is excluded from the one-year period. If you have passed an exam at another university as part of your ITU study programme, this exam will be included in the one-year period.",

How to convert credits to ECTS when studying abroad If the course(s) you want to have pre-approved are not ECTS-based, you must document how many credits/points/units cover a full time semester at the foreign university. For example: University X requires 120 credits to obtain a bachelor degree. The bachelor degree takes 8 semesters to complete (4 years). Hence, 120 credits is divided by 8 semesters, which is equal to 15 credits pr. semester. After you have passed the pre-approved courses The pre-approval of courses is a preliminary approval. It is not the actual transfer of credits from another educational institution. You must submit documentation of passed and non-passed courses that have been pre-approved by the university. You should do this as soon as you receive a transcript of your records. Send the documentation along with the original pre-approval letter from Student Affairs and Programmes by email to sap@itu.dk. If you are not going to use your pre-approval You must notify the IT University if you are not using your pre-approval, as you must be registered for study activities at the IT University instead. If you forget to tell us, the pre-approval will block you from registering for other courses. If your application is rejected or only partly approved, you can file a complaint. You must send the complaint within two weeks from the day you received the decision. No matter who you are complaining to you send the complaint in an email to sap@itu.dk and we will direct it to the department responsible. It can take up to 4 weeks processing your application.

The reply to the application will then follow around first of April (the standard processing time being 4 weeks.) If you want to apply in good time, then aim at applying for Autumn courses already during Spring. And vice versa apply for Spring courses during the autumn semester leading up. For Individual specialisations be aware of this Keep in mind that you will need to have the approval, to be able to register for a specific course the coming semester. Therefore apply in good time with regards to the registration periods. Find them here An approved specialisation does not guarantee you a spot on the course. How to apply Fill out the application form Make a provisional study plan Include the relevant documentation: Link to course descriptions including the number of credits awarded for the course Course title and course code (add an English course title to be used on your final ITU diploma). Conversion to ECTS (if the course is not in ECTS). Please add a link to document how the conversion is made. Link to where the level of the course is documented (BSc or MSc). Students on Master and Diploma (part time programmes) will also have to submit documentation that they have had two years of full-time work experience prior to following the course. This is NOT a requirement for BSc and MSc students. You must enclose documentation as links (e.g. to a university’s course catalogue). Make sure that links are stable. You do not need to send us ITU-Diplomas or course descriptions for ITU-courses. We only need documentation from other universities. Send the application to Student Affairs and Programmes at sap@itu.dk. The handling of your application begins after the deadline. It involves different tasks in order to secure the academic output for you, when taking courses outside of ITU. This involves evaluating and comparing the courses that are listed for pre-approval, to guarantee that it matches you programme. Because different people are involved at different times, and because of the amount of applications we normally receive, the processing time is 4 weeks. We always work hard to have a reply for you as soon as possible. Useful informationHow to convert credits to ECTS when studying abroadIf the course(s) you want to have pre-approved are not ECTS-based, you must document how many credits/points/units cover a full time semester at the foreign university. For example: University X requires 120 credits to obtain a bachelor degree. The bachelor degree takes 8 semesters to complete (4 years). Hence, 120 credits is divided by 8 semesters, which is equal to 15 credits pr. semester.After you have passed the pre-approved coursesThe pre-approval of courses is a preliminary approval. It is not the actual transfer of credits from another educational institution. You must submit documentation of passed and non-passed courses that have been pre-approved by the university. You should do this as soon as you receive a transcript of your records. Send the documentation along with the original pre-approval letter from Student Affairs and Programmes by email to sap@itu.dk. If you are not going to use your pre-approvalYou must notify the IT University if you are not using your pre-approval, as you must be registered for study activities at the IT University instead. If you forget to tell us, the pre-approval will block you from registering for other courses.

You must send the complaint within two weeks from the day you received the decision. No matter who you are complaining to you send the complaint in an email to sap@itu.dk and we will direct it to the department responsible. It can take up to 4 weeks processing your application.

You learn about the important aspects of game development and are introduced to the various roles and responsibilities of the needed competencies. During October, you have the opportunity to focus on a specific aspect in game development that relates to your own specific competencies. The DADIU Curriculum consists of a series of individual courses organized by DADIU. How do I sign up for these courses? You spend the last two months of the DADIU semester on developing and completing a real computer game. Each team of approximately 15 students will have a production room with computers and software available.",

From October/April, you will be able to see a list of course titles for the coming semester. Full descriptions of the courses are available in November/May[date may be changed].Semester length and LearnITTeaching runs from Monday in week 5 and 35. Each course is taught for 14 weeks, though the course periods run for either 15 or 16 weeks, depending on bank holidays. The details for each course are available through LearnIT one week before the semester starts at the latest. You must be registered for a course in order to access it.Mandatory activitiesCourses may have mandatory activities that you need to pass in order to sit for the exam. Descriptions of the mandatory activities are available in the course base.Course evaluationsEach semester, you evaluate all your courses. You have ample possibility of sharing your opinion in the two-step Course evaluation during each course.ECTS and workloadOne ECTS corresponds to 27.5 hours of work for the students which is in line with the official Bologna process A 7.5 ECTS course therefore represents around 206 hours of activity in total. It is difficult to be more specific when speaking about all courses, but it serves as a basis for calculation. Assuming it will take 40 hours to prepare for exam in a 14 week course, this leaves an average of 11.8 work hours per week in those 14 weeks. Projects Project work is an important part of the MSc programme. It offers the opportunity to delve deeper into specific areas that interest you or your project group. Project work also allows for a more in-depth engagement with case organisations. There are different kinds of projects on a MSc programme: Thesis (30 ECTS). Learn more about the Thesis Re project (7,5 ECTS) Individual projects / Elective projects (7,5 or 15 ECTS). Summer Projects. (7,5 or 15 ECTS) Projects as part of a course You can use elective modules for writing a project under supervision, rather than taking an elective. You register for the project in the registration period. You can chose to work on your own project entirely, collaborate with a company or do a group project. Re Project The re project is intended as the bridge between your specialisation and your thesis. It allows you to focus very narrowly and in great detail on the particular sub-topics of your specialisation that will then be used in your thesis. The re project is formally a project like any other, however, we do offer some help and guidelines for finding a supervisor. The content of the project is not limited, but is intended to feed into your thesis. The re project very often takes the form of a narrowly focused literature study or a prototype implementation or use of particular software tools. See here for more information about the Re Project Specially for KCS- and KSD-students studying abroad If you are going abroad in the semester just before writing your thesis, you can take an elective abroad instead of writing the Re Project – preapproval for the elective is still necessary. Additionally, you are recommended to attend the Re Project Introduction meeting at ITU in week 35. The introduction meeting will is informative with regards to the Master thesis as well. If this is not possible then check up on the general information about the Re project, since it also shares details about the thesis. (See link just above)",

In the labs, you can do experiments, build prototypes, get help realizing your projects, get help to connect with industry, attend extracurricular activities and meet like-minded students and faculty. The Air Lab explores affective designs for living with digital technologies, and how such affective interactions can change our relations to the world, each other and ourselves. AIR lab supports bachelor projects, master thesis projects, and re projects. These projects can develop prototypes, set up tests, borrow equipment, and get support for prototyping and working with our equipment and technical infrastructures. Monday 10:00 - 15:00 Wednesday 12:30 - 16:30 Thursday 10:00 - 15:00 BUILD, the data innovation lab, seeks to provide an environment for students, industry, and reers, where innovation can be driven by data learnings in both the qualitative and quantitative sense. BUILD Lab supports scoping and finding the appropriate case for a: course, bachelor and master thesis, or re project. By getting in touch, you can get access to the network of cases and a variety of data with the purpose of finding one that is suitable for your project. Drop in: Wednesday 11:00 - 14:30 Appointment only: Tuesday 11:00 - 14:30 Thursday 12:30 - 16:00 The ITU brAIn lab is a space and a group of people with a common interest in re and education at the crossroads between machine learning, psychophysiology, neuroscience and cognition. Within the lab, reers and students collaborate to develop computational models of different aspects of the human mind and design experiments to capture and synthesise the user experience in complex digital media like video games and virtual reality. At the DASYA Lab (Data-Intensive Systems and Applications) Lab, we build the infrastructure of data science. Our focus is on scalable and efficient systems supporting the data lifecycle, including collection, transfer, storage, processing, analytics and curation. Here, you will find support and resources from arduino to android, from raspberry to regular expressions, from UI to IoT, from 3D printing to data portals, from soldering to sensors to smart things to servers. Monday 14:00 - 16:00 Wednesday 13:00 - 16:00 Friday 13:00 - 15:00 The Human Data Interaction Lab (or hdilab in short) focuses on the human factors in the conception, use, and understanding of data. The lab functions as a venue for discussing matters related to human data interaction broadly and invites students and faculty to join forces to better understand these aspects ETHOS Lab is an experimental space for exploring data and data landscapes in contemporary society. Here you will find room for methodological and analytical exploration. Each semester, the Lab offers workshops, tools training, and public talks about methods. Students can apply for a position as Junior Reer in the lab and join one of our study groups. Tuesday 12:30 - 16:00 Thursday 12:30 - 16:00 The Game Lab is a space for exploring playful ideas. Whether you want to work on a VR game, run a machine learning experiment or test a multiplayer toy on the big screen, this room offers equipment to work on your games and playful experiences. Each semester, the Game Lab hosts a number of workshops and talks and it is also home of the Demo Night, a bi-monthly event where students as well as industry guests show and discuss unfinished projects. At IxD Lab, we focus on physical interaction design, material exploration and modern fabrication technologies. We support courses that demand tools such as 3D printing, laser cutting, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and we have a stock of sensors and actuators. In addition, we offer training and guidance in technical aspects of rapid prototyping and material choice, and occasionally we host talks about interaction design. Drop in Thursday 9:00 - 12:00 (Tech and prototype support) Thursday 13:00 - 16:00 (Tech support) Appointment only Wednesday 9:00 - 12:00 The Robotics, Evolution and Artificial Life (REAL) Lab hosts projects involving robotics, bio-inspired artificial intelligence, art and mechatronics. We have resources to build prototypes and robots: an industrial robotic arm (UR5), 8 small wheeled robots (Thymio), and 2 liquid handling robots. We can also provide access to computer clusters and high performance GPUs. You should a member of the REAL to get access. In Study Lab, teaching assistants help students with course topics that the students find difficult. Your teachers can tell you more.

Study activities are specific courses and projects that can fill out a module, and in order to fulfill the requirements in your curriculum, you must fill out all modules. The study activities that are available can change each semester, but the modules are always available. Some courses are mandatory, some you chose as electives and for some electives you can decide to convert the ECTS into an elective project. Mandatory Courses Some modules are filled with mandatory courses. Mandatory courses are courses that you have to take at specific points in a specific order during the course of your studies. The courses are often divided into lectures or class teaching and following exercises. 1st semester students are administratively registered for their mandatory courses on their first semester, but from there on students need to register for their mandatory courses in the registration periods. Electives Some modules are reserved for electives. Electives are courses that you decide on yourself but you must choose electives that are within the objectives of your programme. You can use an elective to steer your studies towards your individual interests, to inspire you for future projects or to supplement future specialisations.

ECTS and workloadOne ECTS corresponds to 27.5 hours of work for the students which is in line with the official Bologna process A 7.5 ECTS course therefore represents around 206 hours of activity in total. It is difficult to be more specific when speaking about all courses, but it serves as a basis for calculation. Assuming it will take 40 hours to prepare for exam in a 14 week course, this leaves an average of 11.8 work hours per week in those 14 weeks. Useful information concerning courses You can find descriptions of the current courses in the course catalogue in LearnIT / All courses. From October/April, you will be able to see a list of course titles for the coming semester. Full descriptions of the courses are available in November/May[date may be changed].

It offers the opportunity to delve deeper into specific areas that interest you or your project group. Project work also allows for a more in-depth engagement with case organisations. There are different kinds of projects on a BSc programme: You can use elective modules for writing a project under supervision, rather than taking an elective. You register for the project in the registration period. You can chose to work on your own project entirely, collaborate with a company or do a group project.",

Based on your information, we will determine if you qualify for a compulsory credit transfer. The compulsory credit transfer we might grant you when starting your studies only relates to the mandatory courses on your programme. If you want courses taken in the past, to substitute elective modules here at ITU, you must apply for a credit transfer. If awarded this, you cannot take the course in question (ECTS) at ITU.

      "Confidentiality agreementA Confidentiality Agreement is between you and the company, and ITU is not a part of the agreement. Both supervisor and examiner are obliged to follow the duty of confidentiality in general. Therefore, you do not need a signature from your supervisor or any other ITU representative. For this reason as well, you must be extra careful what you agree to, as the agreement is your responsibility.Confidentiality and Rights agreementA Confidentiality and Rights Agreement is between you, ITU and the Company. Please be aware that certain provisions regarding e.g. confidentiality, examination and rights to ITU’s intellectual property cannot be changed as ITU are bound by the rules in the University Act, the Examination Act, the Re Patent Act and the state aid rules. The non-negotiable provisions are marked as such in the agreement. If these provisions are changed in any way, ITU consider the agreement invalid. You can always change the provisions concerning your own rights to intellectual property. Have it signed by ITU It is a requirement that ITU’s pro-rector sign this type of agreement. Therefore, please  legal@itu.dk for such. Involving ITU Legal?You are not entitled to use ITU Legal, as this is a service to the University staff that can be used as part of their work. Legal will often get involved in your project through the supervisor, but please be aware that it is the supervisor's interests that Legal are protecting and not yours. However, Legal has tried to consider the interests of students in preparing the standard contract Confidentiality and Rights agreement.Mark as confidentialIf necessary, you can mark in LearnIT that the assignment is confidential, when you submit it. In addition, the oral exam will be held behind closed doors, i.e. without an audience, on your request.RecommendationsWe recommend that you show any agreement to your supervisor before you sign it, so you and your supervisor can ensure that the agreement does not contain elements, which are in violation with ITU regulations for projects and exams. Things to consider1. Remember, it is not a requirement in general to enter into a Confidentiality Agreement or an Agreement on Confidentiality and Rights with companies. 2. Make sure you understand the content and consequences of the agreement. 3. Remember that you own the intellectual property rights (IPR) in the works you produce. 4. Remember that you and the company often have conflicting interests. 5. Make sure that you are given a fair remuneration for your project results. You should rather not be the new student who develops a new , without getting a piece of the cake! 6. Remember to be credited for your work 7. Remember that the goal is for you to pass your exam! How to set up a projectA project executed in collaboration with a company must be set up as any other project at ITU; you must register the project in the same way, observe the same deadlines, find a supervisor from ITU who will accept your project and supervise you, etc. The project must also meet the same academic standard as other projects at ITU. This means, that you must discuss the problem statement with the ITU supervisor, and find out how the company can be used as a case in the final assignment. Finding a CompanyThere are several ways to get in touch with a company: Many companies have uploaded project proposals in the Job- and Project Bank (you might also check the Project Banks of other Universities). Take a look at companies that have posted internships as well; often these will be interested in project collaboration. Twice a year The Study and Career Guidance hosts an event, where the companies/organizations who are interested in collaborating with students visit ITU. See the calendar for The Study and Career Guidance here. If you are looking at potential companies that you think would be interesting to work with, do not hesitate to  them. Many companies are interested in working with students. Some teachers are in  with companies on their own – you can then ask the person you have in mind to supervise your project. Discuss mutual expectations with the companyIt is a good idea to discuss your individual expectations, before you start the project collaboration. You can ask yourself questions like: Why does the company wish to collaborate with students and what are their expectations in terms of the outcome of this collaboration? What are their expectations in regards to how the project collaboration will go about? Does the company have any preferences in terms of method, theoretical approach, the design of the study etc.? Access to important data at the companyBefore you make an agreement with a company or organization, you should make sure that it is possible for you to gain access to relevant data, which is important for your project. This means that you should: Make sure you have a  person at the company who has time to meet up with you or your group. If you need to conduct interviews etc., you should make sure that the company is prepared for that. Ensure that you have the opportunity to gain access to relevant material, such as: Meeting summaries, reports, software, documentation etc. GDPRWill you be working with personal data with a company or organization?

If you need your title for the project changed you need to write to sap@itu.dk. The title in STADS is the title that will go on your diploma. This goes for the supervisor as well. If you registered with a project description and your project has changed, you are not able to update it on the project page. The problem statement though can be added and edited until the formal deadline. Afterwards you cannot edit it. Important If you and your supervisor agree, you can implement any change you want in the actual project. Your project description or problem statement will not be part of the assessment. If you have substantial changes to the problem statement, method or the like, you may want to describe them in an appendix or a summary about the project process in the finished project.Courses: File size and typesIt is up to the Course manager to decide if students are allowed to upload 1 or 5 files, in LearnIT when submitting a course assignment. All students need to check the exam activity on LearnIT for information about this. The standard is that students can upload up until 5GB and all file types are allowed. If there are any restrictions it will say so on the course description in LearnIT. Also, to make sure your files do not exceed the maximum permitted, you can compress them in a .zip file. Here is a walk-through how to do that.Projects: File size and typesFor a project the standard file size has a maximum of 100MB. The different types of files can be: .odt,.pdf,.rtf,.docx,.doc,.pptx,.ppt,.html,.htm,.sxw,.txt Besides the one file that is the project you are able to upload 5 appendices, with a maximum size of 2GB for each. Always check the exam activity in LearnIT, when in doubt. Also, to make sure your files do not exceed the maximum permitted, you can compress them in a .zip file. Here is a walk-through how to do that. You must not upload files that are protected, i.e. password protected or encrypted. Can I submit after the deadline?No, the system will close down for any uploads after the deadline. You can apply for an exemption to hand in after the deadline, but it needs to be on the basis of Special circumstances If you want to apply, you should send the application as soon as possible and attach the assignment to the email. Remember to argue why you should be exempted. Also see above, if you did not hand-in due to problems related to uploading in LearnIT. If you do not submit within the deadline or if your application for exemption is rejected, a \"not attended\" (udeblevet) will be registered for the exam. Can I replace a submitted assignment/project with a newer version?At first, you will upload a draft. You can edit the draft or submit it. Once you have submitted, you cannot edit your submission. You can apply for an exemption from the rule, but this will often have to be on the basis of special circumstances. Do all group members have to upload a copy?When you submit an assignment as a group, you should upload the project just once. Any member of the group can upload the project, and he or she must add the other group members in the submission window in LearnIT.Should I submit a blank sheet, if I can't submit any work?No, you shouldn't submit anything. You will get a \"u\" for \"udeblevet\" (absent). It can mistakenly be registered as a submission for the exam, if you submit a blank sheet.What if my work is confidential?When you submit in LearnIT, you can choose to make the submission \"confidential\" and only the examiners will be able to see it. You can ask if the oral examination can be held behind closed doors, but kindly note that it’s up to the examiners if they accommodate your requests. Please use the possibility of confidentiality with care, as important knowledge sharing will be lost if it is used too often.",

      "Before the examPreparation for online examThis is a recommended minimum list to aid you prepare the exam. Technical Install Zoom on your computer Use an external microphone if you have one. They are usually better than built-in ones Ensure in advance that you have working web camera, microphone and internet connection Invite a fellow student to test equipment including speaker, microphone and setup with you in good time Install the latest Zoom app on a mobile device with data subscription in case of technical issues and weak or unstable connections Practical Practice your exam in Zoom to be familiar with the environment Arrange in advance how you will handle writing/drawing during the exam if needed. Get inspiration and useful advice on annotation with Zoom, whiteboard in zoom, sharing ipad screen for drawing in Zoom from these video tutorials regarding Zoom Place yourself so you have a balanced backlight so others can see you better. Avoid sunlight from the sides and back. Group exams Unless your teacher decides otherwise and communicates this at the latest 7 days before the group exam, students attending a group exam are allowed to be in the same room during the exam. The ITU recommendation is that students who are in the same room during a group exam log onto Zoom individually using their own device and mute their microphone when they do not speak in order to avoid feedback loop Security - online oral examsAll online oral exams take place on Zoom. IT security guidelines must be adhered to.

      "During the examGuidelinesThese guidelines were approved by Board of Studies 5 May 2020: Students and examiners must have the camera on during the entire examination (except when sharing screen as this setting does not allow using the camera at the same time) in order to make the online exam as close as possible to ordinary face-to-face exams. Having the camera permanently on also is a measure for the examiners to evaluate if students are cheating. Examiner starts the exam and goes through how the meeting will proceed. The identity of the student must be established. If asked by the examiners, student must show student card. ITU trusts that students adhere to the exam rules and that students do not receive any help during the exam. If asked by the examiners, student must show the room they are located in. The student can display a background picture to maintain privacy. E.g. this one of ITU. During presentation it is recommended that non-speakers microphones are unmuted. The examiner ends the exam when the time has expired and makes sure that students are not attending the voting. If any unforeseen incidents happen, it is a good idea to describe and document what happened. According to the Examination Order, audio or video recording of an exam is not allowed unless the recordings are part of the examination. In such cases, the University undertakes the recording. The recording must thus not take place if the sole aim is to use the recording in the case of an exam complaint or to reveal cheating. How to make the online conversation run smoothly Speak as clearly as possible Wait a little bit longer for people to finish sentences so you don't risk interrupting them Acknowledge what other people are saying with nods, not confirming sounds or words as the risk disturbing the speaker Raise your hand so others can see you want to say something Consider using Zoom's push-to-talk function to avoid broadcasting unintended noise. The Push to Talk feature allows you to remain muted throughout your Zoom meeting and hold down the spacebar when you want to be unmuted and talk Join the Zoom meeting Log on to the Zoom meeting using the link provided in LearnIT by your teacher/supervisor If you have technical issues, use the Zoom app on your mobile phone to join the meeting If the Zoom app on your phone does not work either, you can call the meeting via phone using the Zoom Dial-in number provided by your teacher/supervisor The exam itself Once joining the meeting, you will be automatically placed in a waiting room. To access the examination room, you will be invited in by the examiner You say your name and authenticate yourself. If asked by the examiners, you must show student ID card Depending on the exam there will be a method for drawing of exam question - not relevant for all exams You present Your teacher and the external examiner ask questions For answers requiring different tools to e.g., write code, draw a diagram, etc.: Share your screen (see tutorial) Use the shared whiteboard in Zoom With regards to writing code, you will be allowed to use the Integrated Development Environment of your choice With regards to drawing diagrams, you will be allowed to use the tool of your choice as long as this does not become a reason for delays. In case of delays or if you prefer, you will be allowed to draw diagrams on a sheet of paper that is afterwards shown to the camera Once the exam is completed, the examiner will place you in a Zoom breakout room Stay online and await in another Zoom breakout room while your teacher and external examiner discuss your performance The examiner invites you back into the exam breakout room for the result Group exams Like it is the case for face-to-face exams, students can ask to get their grade without the presence of the fellow students.What happens if there a technical issues? If the internet connection or camera fail: Install the Zoom app on your phone before the exam so you can move to a mobile device if needs be. Call the meeting via phone using the Zoom Dial-in number provided by your teacher/supervisor If you have problems with your WIFI connection: Use cable instead Place yourself close to the router Turn off other devices that use the router (streaming of film, music, etc.) It can be a solution to log on from two devices. Remember to move both devices between the Zoom breakout rooms. Also remember to mute one device (otherwise potential doom of feedback loop). No video - only audio If you experience issues with video but is still available to attend with audio, the examiners assess whether there is a risk of cheating or if the exam can be carried through with only audio. If one of the examiners experiences issues with video, the exam is carried through, unless the examiner depends on video to pursue the examination. Extension of exam If the duration of the interruption caused by technical problems corresponds to less than 1/5 of the exam, the examiner adds the time spent re-establishing communications to the exam.",

Find all the tutorials regarding the below here in ITU Media Which information will my teacher provide before the exam? At least 7 days before the exam, your teacher will via LearnIT provide you with the exact time, link to the meeting in Zoom and other relevant information During the examGuidelinesThese guidelines were approved by Board of Studies 5 May 2020: Students and examiners must have the camera on during the entire examination (except when sharing screen as this setting does not allow using the camera at the same time) in order to make the online exam as close as possible to ordinary face-to-face exams. Having the camera permanently on also is a measure for the examiners to evaluate if students are cheating. Examiner starts the exam and goes through how the meeting will proceed. The identity of the student must be established. If asked by the examiners, student must show student card. ITU trusts that students adhere to the exam rules and that students do not receive any help during the exam. If asked by the examiners, student must show the room they are located in. The student can display a background picture to maintain privacy. E.g. this one of ITU. During presentation it is recommended that non-speakers microphones are unmuted. The examiner ends the exam when the time has expired and makes sure that students are not attending the voting. If any unforeseen incidents happen, it is a good idea to describe and document what happened. According to the Examination Order, audio or video recording of an exam is not allowed unless the recordings are part of the examination. In such cases, the University undertakes the recording. The recording must thus not take place if the sole aim is to use the recording in the case of an exam complaint or to reveal cheating. How to make the online conversation run smoothly Speak as clearly as possible Wait a little bit longer for people to finish sentences so you don't risk interrupting them Acknowledge what other people are saying with nods, not confirming sounds or words as the risk disturbing the speaker Raise your hand so others can see you want to say something Consider using Zoom's push-to-talk function to avoid broadcasting unintended noise.

Call the meeting via phone using the Zoom Dial-in number provided by your teacher/supervisor If you have problems with your WIFI connection: Use cable instead Place yourself close to the router Turn off other devices that use the router (streaming of film, music, etc.) It can be a solution to log on from two devices. Remember to move both devices between the Zoom breakout rooms. Also remember to mute one device (otherwise potential doom of feedback loop). No video - only audio If you experience issues with video but is still available to attend with audio, the examiners assess whether there is a risk of cheating or if the exam can be carried through with only audio. If one of the examiners experiences issues with video, the exam is carried through, unless the examiner depends on video to pursue the examination. Extension of exam If the duration of the interruption caused by technical problems corresponds to less than 1/5 of the exam, the examiner adds the time spent re-establishing communications to the exam.

      "Each programme consists of modules and study activities. Study activities are specific courses and projects that can fill out a module, and in order to fulfill the requirements in your curriculum, you must fill out all modules. The study activities that are available can change each semester, but the modules are always available. Some courses are mandatory, some you chose as electives and for some electives you can decide to convert the ECTS into an elective project. Mandatory Courses Some modules are filled with mandatory courses. Mandatory courses are courses that you have to take at specific points in a specific order during the course of your studies. The courses are often divided into lectures or class teaching and following exercises. You are automatically registered for the mandatory courses on your current semester. Electives Some modules are reserved for electives. The electives and the master’s thesis offer opportunities for shaping your own profile. You decide on the courses yourself but you must choose electives that are within the objectives of your programme. You can use the electives to further shape your profile and together with the Re Project prepare for your thesis. Special academic prerequisites?For some students their educational background might qualify them for courses outside the course list.

If your syllabus contains difficult literature (for example of a highly technical, philosophical or mathematical nature) which requires time to understand, your syllabus for a project can be reduced. If you develop a product as part of your project, the teacher can reduce the syllabus as appropriate. Especially for these programmesEspecially for GAMESThe general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for the GAMES study programme. Because of the inherent interdisciplinarity of the programme, the syllabus is often a mix of technical papers, other academic articles and books. A suitable guideline is that all reports should cite at least as many sources as they have pages. If students develop a product as part of a project or exam assignment, the supervisor can reduce the syllabus as appropriate. Especially for SWU, DS, SD and CSThe general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for SWU, DS, SD & CS study programmes. This is because syllabus on these programmes often contains a lot of coding and very little text. Coding has a very compressed nature compared to text. This applies for both courses, exam assignments and projects. Supervisor/course manager decide the syllabus for these study programmes. Especially for these programmes The general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for the GAMES study programme. Because of the inherent interdisciplinarity of the programme, the syllabus is often a mix of technical papers, other academic articles and books. A suitable guideline is that all reports should cite at least as many sources as they have pages. Especially for SWU, DS, SD and CS General rules How much you need to write depends on the subject area and on the balance between text and the development of a product or other practical work. Therefore, you agree upon how much you need to write with the supervisor based on what is appropriate in your specific case. Standard page and body sizeA standard page is 2,400 units per page, including spaces and notes. The standard page range indicated on this page refers to the body of the written work. The body includes the preface and all original text that is part of the original argumentation and message plus citations. The body does not include: front page, colophon, table of contents, abstract, bibliography, appendices and illustrations and charts There is no upper or lower limit to the page span of the elements not included in the body. Body versus appendices The exact division can be tricky at times, but a general rule of thumb is that the body is the line of argumentation, while the appendix material serves to substantiate the argument(s).

Especially for GAMES individual projectsGAMES individual projects Number of students 7.5 ECTS project 15 ECTS project 1 7.5-15 pages 15-30 pages 2 10-20 pages 20-40 pages 3 13-26 pages 26-52 pages 4 17-34 pages 34-68 pages Especially for GAMES individual projects GAMES individual projects When you write a bachelor or a thesis, there are other guidelines. How much you should write depends on the subject area and on the balance between text and the development of a product. Therefore, you agree upon how much you should write with your supervisor based on what is appropriate in your bachelor project/thesis. This becomes even more important if you develop a product as part of your bachelor project/thesis. In such cases, it is important that you have a dialogue with your supervisor about how much you should write. It is important that your supervisor approves any deviations from the guidelines below. Guidelines for bachelor projectsData Science bachelor projectThe general project size guidelines are not suitable for Data Science bachelor projects, because Data Science bachelor projects often contain a lot of coding and very little text.

We encourage you, as a first step, to visit SU.dk, where you will find help and guidance for understanding the new SU rules. For information in English, please go to: SU reform - English What does the reform mean for me? What is new? From January 2027, the maximum SU grant portions in total will be reduced from 70 to 58. When the new rules for SU come into effect from January 2027 onwards, the 70 SU grant portions you can receive will be reduced to 58 if you have started a new education after July 1, 2025. Therefore, you may have SU grant portions that will lapse when the limit is reduced from 70 to 58.

You must register for all your study activities yourself: (all new BSc and MSc students are administratively registered for their first semester) A limit to your registrations You cannot exceed the registration limit of 37,5 ECTS pr. semester. The only exception is, if for the Spring semester you want to register for 37, 5 ECTS + a Summer University course, then you write sap@itu.dk. In general, if you have issues making a registration send an e-mail to sap@itu.dk in the registration period, and we will look into it. Mandatory courses Your registration for a mandatory course on your programme will secure you a seat on the course. Electives Your registration for elective courses is only a wish. Getting a seat has to do with how many who registered for it and how the seats are allocated. For this reason you should always register a second priority for your electives. Are you pushing courses?If you are considering to push courses and not register for the standard 30 ECTS, please SEE HERE for what to be aware of. Are you pushing courses? Specialisation courses Your registration for a specialisation course that is standard to your programme will secure you a seat on the course. This goes for the 2nd (and 3rd) part as well. A registration for a course that is part of an approved individual specialisation is only a wish. Getting a seat has to do with how many who registered for it and how the seats are allocated. You can find the principles for the allocation of course seats here. How to registerYou register in My Study Activities. First and second priorities (Electives only*) The number of courses that you give first priority indicates the number of courses you want to register for, therefore if you need to register for two courses, you should give both courses first priority. Your choice of second priority course will only be taken into consideration, if you are not awarded a seat in the course(s) that you have given first priority. During the period for changing registrations in the beginning of the semester, you cannot prioritise registrations. * For mandatory courses or specialisation courses you do not need to have a second priority.

Set the filters to The relevant semester and Elective to and then choose your own study programme.Remember to check if the courses you sign up for are scheduled to run at the same time. In the weeks up until the registration opens, a list of approved courses will be shared for each programme with the courses available to choose from. Find the list in LearnIT. Set the filters to The relevant semester and Elective to and then choose your own study programme. Please be aware If you are choosing electives approved for you, but from a different study programme, the course can require specific knowledge you might not have. The courses facilitated by your own Study Programme should fit in with your acquired knowledge and skills, but do remember to check up on the prerequisites.Special academic prerequisites?For some students their educational background might qualify them for courses outside the course list. Please read more here Special academic prerequisites? For some students their educational background might qualify them for courses outside the course list.

      "Confidentiality agreementA Confidentiality Agreement is between you and the company, and ITU is not a part of the agreement. Both supervisor and examiner are obliged to follow the duty of confidentiality in general. Therefore, you do not need a signature from your supervisor or any other ITU representative. For this reason as well, you must be extra careful what you agree to, as the agreement is your responsibility.Confidentiality and Rights agreementA Confidentiality and Rights Agreement is between you, ITU and the Company. Please be aware that certain provisions regarding e.g. confidentiality, examination and rights to ITU’s intellectual property cannot be changed as ITU are bound by the rules in the University Act, the Examination Act, the Re Patent Act and the state aid rules. The non-negotiable provisions are marked as such in the agreement. If these provisions are changed in any way, ITU consider the agreement invalid. You can always change the provisions concerning your own rights to intellectual property. Have it signed by ITU It is a requirement that ITU’s pro-rector sign this type of agreement. Therefore, please  legal@itu.dk for such. Involving ITU Legal?You are not entitled to use ITU Legal, as this is a service to the University staff that can be used as part of their work. Legal will often get involved in your project through the supervisor, but please be aware that it is the supervisor's interests that Legal are protecting and not yours. However, Legal has tried to consider the interests of students in preparing the standard contract Confidentiality and Rights agreement.Mark as confidentialIf necessary, you can mark in LearnIT that the assignment is confidential, when you submit it. In addition, the oral exam will be held behind closed doors, i.e. without an audience, on your request.RecommendationsWe recommend that you show any agreement to your supervisor before you sign it, so you and your supervisor can ensure that the agreement does not contain elements, which are in violation with ITU regulations for projects and exams. Things to consider1. Remember, it is not a requirement in general to enter into a Confidentiality Agreement or an Agreement on Confidentiality and Rights with companies. 2. Make sure you understand the content and consequences of the agreement. 3. Remember that you own the intellectual property rights (IPR) in the works you produce. 4. Remember that you and the company often have conflicting interests. 5. Make sure that you are given a fair remuneration for your project results. You should rather not be the new student who develops a new , without getting a piece of the cake! 6. Remember to be credited for your work 7. Remember that the goal is for you to pass your exam! How to set up a projectA project executed in collaboration with a company must be set up as any other project at ITU; you must register the project in the same way, observe the same deadlines, find a supervisor from ITU who will accept your project and supervise you, etc. The project must also meet the same academic standard as other projects at ITU. This means, that you must discuss the problem statement with the ITU supervisor, and find out how the company can be used as a case in the final assignment. Finding a CompanyThere are several ways to get in touch with a company: Many companies have uploaded project proposals in the Job- and Project Bank (you might also check the Project Banks of other Universities). Take a look at companies that have posted internships as well; often these will be interested in project collaboration. Twice a year The Study and Career Guidance hosts an event, where the companies/organizations who are interested in collaborating with students visit ITU. See the calendar for The Study and Career Guidance here. If you are looking at potential companies that you think would be interesting to work with, do not hesitate to  them. Many companies are interested in working with students. Some teachers are in  with companies on their own – you can then ask the person you have in mind to supervise your project. Discuss mutual expectations with the companyIt is a good idea to discuss your individual expectations, before you start the project collaboration. You can ask yourself questions like: Why does the company wish to collaborate with students and what are their expectations in terms of the outcome of this collaboration? What are their expectations in regards to how the project collaboration will go about? Does the company have any preferences in terms of method, theoretical approach, the design of the study etc.? Access to important data at the companyBefore you make an agreement with a company or organization, you should make sure that it is possible for you to gain access to relevant data, which is important for your project. This means that you should: Make sure you have a  person at the company who has time to meet up with you or your group. If you need to conduct interviews etc., you should make sure that the company is prepared for that. Ensure that you have the opportunity to gain access to relevant material, such as: Meeting summaries, reports, software, documentation etc. GDPRWill you be working with personal data with a company or organization?

The well-known types are s, patents, trademarks, designs and trade secrets that often hold a significant value to companies. Students, who are not employees at ITU own the intellectual property rights (IPR) in the works they produce.It is also possible to collaborate with a company on a project. Collaborating with a company while you are studying gives you the opportunity to: Intellectual property rights and confidentiality Intellectual property (IP) is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. The well-known types are s, patents, trademarks, designs and trade secrets that often hold a significant value to companies. Students, who are not employees at ITU own the intellectual property rights (IPR) in the works they produce. ITU recommends that aspects of confidentiality and intellectual property rights are discussed before starting such projects. This is among other things to ensure that you do not enter into a contract with a company on unfair terms, such as to waive all the rights to your IP without any remuneration. Agreements Here you can find an example of a Confidentiality Agreement Here you can find an example of a Confidentiality and Rights Agreement PLEASE NOTE You need to email the Confidentiality and Rights agreement to legal@itu.dk for a signature, before it can be of any use. Before sending it both the student and the company needs to have signed the agreement. ITU has prepared an example of a so-called Confidentiality Agreement and a Confidentiality and Rights Agreement for a student project that you and the company can use. This is not a requirement; However, ITU will only co-sign an agreement for a student project, if the agreement is based on our template, see section on the Confidentiality and Rights Agreement below. Here you can find an example of a Confidentiality Agreement Here you can find an example of a Confidentiality and Rights Agreement You need to email the Confidentiality and Rights agreement to legal@itu.dk for a signature, before it can be of any use. Before sending it both the student and the company needs to have signed the agreement. Many companies prefer to use their own agreement, but ITU will not sign these, and you can only commit yourself – and not ITU – to the content with your signature. Confidentiality agreementA Confidentiality Agreement is between you and the company, and ITU is not a part of the agreement. Both supervisor and examiner are obliged to follow the duty of confidentiality in general. Therefore, you do not need a signature from your supervisor or any other ITU representative. For this reason as well, you must be extra careful what you agree to, as the agreement is your responsibility.Confidentiality and Rights agreementA Confidentiality and Rights Agreement is between you, ITU and the Company. Please be aware that certain provisions regarding e.g. confidentiality, examination and rights to ITU’s intellectual property cannot be changed as ITU are bound by the rules in the University Act, the Examination Act, the Re Patent Act and the state aid rules. The non-negotiable provisions are marked as such in the agreement. If these provisions are changed in any way, ITU consider the agreement invalid. You can always change the provisions concerning your own rights to intellectual property. Have it signed by ITU It is a requirement that ITU’s pro-rector sign this type of agreement. Therefore, please legal@itu.dk for such. Involving ITU Legal?You are not entitled to use ITU Legal, as this is a service to the University staff that can be used as part of their work. Legal will often get involved in your project through the supervisor, but please be aware that it is the supervisor's interests that Legal are protecting and not yours. However, Legal has tried to consider the interests of students in preparing the standard contract Confidentiality and Rights agreement.Mark as confidentialIf necessary, you can mark in LearnIT that the assignment is confidential, when you submit it. In addition, the oral exam will be held behind closed doors, i.e. without an audience, on your request.RecommendationsWe recommend that you show any agreement to your supervisor before you sign it, so you and your supervisor can ensure that the agreement does not contain elements, which are in violation with ITU regulations for projects and exams. Things to consider1. Remember, it is not a requirement in general to enter into a Confidentiality Agreement or an Agreement on Confidentiality and Rights with companies. 2. Make sure you understand the content and consequences of the agreement. 3. Remember that you own the intellectual property rights (IPR) in the works you produce. 4. Remember that you and the company often have conflicting interests. 5. Make sure that you are given a fair remuneration for your project results. You should rather not be the new student who develops a new , without getting a piece of the cake! 6. Remember to be credited for your work 7. Remember that the goal is for you to pass your exam! How to set up a projectA project executed in collaboration with a company must be set up as any other project at ITU; you must register the project in the same way, observe the same deadlines, find a supervisor from ITU who will accept your project and supervise you, etc. The project must also meet the same academic standard as other projects at ITU. This means, that you must discuss the problem statement with the ITU supervisor, and find out how the company can be used as a case in the final assignment. Finding a CompanyThere are several ways to get in touch with a company: Many companies have uploaded project proposals in the Job- and Project Bank (you might also check the Project Banks of other Universities). Take a look at companies that have posted internships as well; often these will be interested in project collaboration. Twice a year The Study and Career Guidance hosts an event, where the companies/organizations who are interested in collaborating with students visit ITU. See the calendar for The Study and Career Guidance here. If you are looking at potential companies that you think would be interesting to work with, do not hesitate to them. Many companies are interested in working with students. Some teachers are in with companies on their own – you can then ask the person you have in mind to supervise your project. Discuss mutual expectations with the companyIt is a good idea to discuss your individual expectations, before you start the project collaboration. You can ask yourself questions like: Why does the company wish to collaborate with students and what are their expectations in terms of the outcome of this collaboration? What are their expectations in regards to how the project collaboration will go about? Does the company have any preferences in terms of method, theoretical approach, the design of the study etc.? Access to important data at the companyBefore you make an agreement with a company or organization, you should make sure that it is possible for you to gain access to relevant data, which is important for your project. This means that you should: Make sure you have a person at the company who has time to meet up with you or your group. If you need to conduct interviews etc., you should make sure that the company is prepared for that. Ensure that you have the opportunity to gain access to relevant material, such as: Meeting summaries, reports, software, documentation etc. GDPRWill you be working with personal data with a company or organization? Please read about your responsibility as a student working with personal data here. Confidentiality agreement A Confidentiality Agreement is between you and the company, and ITU is not a part of the agreement. Both supervisor and examiner are obliged to follow the duty of confidentiality in general. Therefore, you do not need a signature from your supervisor or any other ITU representative.

Standard page and body size Bachelor project and thesis When writing a project, always agree with your supervisor on how much you should read and write. Your supervisor has the final word on the workload, page limit and syllabus for your project, depending on the scope and distribution between re, production and writing in your work. On this page, you can find guidelines that can form the basis of your alignment of expectations with your supervisor. The rule of thumb for minimum syllabus in projects is 500 pages + 300 additional pages per 7.5 ECTS. Examples: This guideline is extremely flexible depending on the subject area and educational level. If your syllabus contains difficult literature (for example of a highly technical, philosophical or mathematical nature) which requires time to understand, your syllabus for a project can be reduced. If you develop a product as part of your project, the teacher can reduce the syllabus as appropriate. Especially for these programmesEspecially for GAMESThe general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for the GAMES study programme. Because of the inherent interdisciplinarity of the programme, the syllabus is often a mix of technical papers, other academic articles and books. A suitable guideline is that all reports should cite at least as many sources as they have pages. If students develop a product as part of a project or exam assignment, the supervisor can reduce the syllabus as appropriate. Especially for SWU, DS, SD and CSThe general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for SWU, DS, SD & CS study programmes. This is because syllabus on these programmes often contains a lot of coding and very little text. Coding has a very compressed nature compared to text. This applies for both courses, exam assignments and projects. Supervisor/course manager decide the syllabus for these study programmes. Especially for these programmes The general syllabus guidelines are not suitable for the GAMES study programme. Because of the inherent interdisciplinarity of the programme, the syllabus is often a mix of technical papers, other academic articles and books. A suitable guideline is that all reports should cite at least as many sources as they have pages. Especially for SWU, DS, SD and CS General rules How much you need to write depends on the subject area and on the balance between text and the development of a product or other practical work. Therefore, you agree upon how much you need to write with the supervisor based on what is appropriate in your specific case. Standard page and body sizeA standard page is 2,400 units per page, including spaces and notes. The standard page range indicated on this page refers to the body of the written work. The body includes the preface and all original text that is part of the original argumentation and message plus citations. The body does not include: front page, colophon, table of contents, abstract, bibliography, appendices and illustrations and charts There is no upper or lower limit to the page span of the elements not included in the body. Body versus appendices The exact division can be tricky at times, but a general rule of thumb is that the body is the line of argumentation, while the appendix material serves to substantiate the argument(s).

How much you should write depends on the subject area and on the balance between text and the development of a product. Therefore, you agree upon how much you should write with your supervisor based on what is appropriate in your bachelor project/thesis. This becomes even more important if you develop a product as part of your bachelor project/thesis. In such cases, it is important that you have a dialogue with your supervisor about how much you should write. It is important that your supervisor approves any deviations from the guidelines below.
